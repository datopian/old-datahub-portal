  "description": "HuNI - Humanities Networked Infrastructure (http://huni.net.au) - is the Australian Virtual Laboratory for the Humanities, funded by the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) project. It brings together data from 32 cultural heritage datasets into a graph database environment powered by Neo4j. Researchers and other users can explore the connections between people, places, organisations, concepts, events and works - and can add relationships between them, as well as building their own virtual collections. HuNI is managed by Deakin University on behalf of a consortium of 13 Australian institutions.",
