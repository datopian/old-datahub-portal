      "about": "n Egypt environmental hazards and impacts have only increased in recent years, and now have reached a level in which they are threatening the lives, health and livelihood of Egypt’s citizens. There is a clear absence of knowledge both amongst citizens and civil society organization on their environmental rights, their right to participate in the management of Egypt’s resources.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Habi Centre for Environmental Rights was founded in July 2001 and seeks to change this. Named after Habi, the ancient God who controlled the annual flooding of the Nile, it was established to establish environmental justice for citizens.",
