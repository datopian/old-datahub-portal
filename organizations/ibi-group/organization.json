  "description": "The Integrative Biomedical Informatics (IBI) group led by Ferran Sanz and Laura I. Furlong, promotes and tackles synergistic and integrative strategies for facing biomedical problems by making use of approaches developed at the IBI group. The IBI group is located at the Parc de Recerca Biom√®dica de Barcelona (PRBB), Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain).\r\n\r\nCurrently, an increasing wealth of information, particularly the one generated by biomedical research, is left unused. There is a great difficulty in both the identification and use of clinically actionable information. The goal of the IBI group is to develop methods and tools to help to solve this problem, with a special focus in methods that promote an understanding of human health and disease.\r\n\r\nweb: http://ibi.imim.es/",
