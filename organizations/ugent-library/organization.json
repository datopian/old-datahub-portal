  "description": "The Ghent University Library is located in the city of Ghent, Belgium. It serves the university community of students and scholarly researchers.\r\n\r\nThe library has evolved in recent years, focusing on decentralization and networking rather than a central facility. Some collections of books are to be found in the faculty libraries; but some books are conventionally gathered together in the University library. A range of electronic resources are available within the UGent network as part of a \"digital library.\r\n\r\nThe Library has joined with Google in digitizing books which will then be made accessible via the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe chief architectural feature of the library is the Book Tower (Boekentoren), designed by Henry van de Velde, and located next to the Blandijn, which houses the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy.\r\n\r\n[ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent_University_Library]",
