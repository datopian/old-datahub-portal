  "description": "AidData is an online portal for information on development finance. AidData has developed the world's largest database of foreign aid projects, amounting to nearly $2 trillion in aid financed by 90+ donors between 1945 and 2012. AidData also offers innovative tools and applications for interacting with and analyzing foreign aid information, including project categorization (activity coding) and location (geocoding).\r\n\r\nAidData contains information from traditional aid sources such as the OECD's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) as well as donors not captured by the CRS and activities that do not fit the OECD definition of Official Development Assistance (ODA). In cooperation with the OECD CRS, AidData augments existing data by publishing more complete project descriptions and more detailed aid project purpose codes. In particular, AidData is dedicated to collecting project-level data from all multilateral donors and non-DAC bilateral donors (NDBs) to provide a more complete picture of development finance flows and activities.",
