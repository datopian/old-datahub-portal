  "description": "The Hubert Curien laboratory is a joint research unit within the Jean Monnet University, Saint-Etienne and the National Research Centre \"CNRS\". It’s therefore the mixed research unit UMR 5516 with 130 researchers and teacher-researchers who are permanent staff, 20 engineers and administrative personnel, 90 PhD and post-PhD students. This makes the Hubert Curien laboratory with a total of 240 staff the most important of all Saint-etienne’s university poles. A large range of activities are divided into two departments: \" Optics photonics and microwave\" and \"Computer science, telecom and image\". The research activities are structured into different scientific projects with 4 main themes: \" Micro/Nano structuration », \"Radiation-matter interaction\", \"Signal processing\" and \"Machine learning\". Particular emphasis over the last four years has been put on developing cross disciplinary scientific projects to create a common culture within and between these two scientific departments. Consequently, this interaction has lead to the Hubert Curien laboratory being able to present a fertile interdisciplinary collaboration in its scientific report. The management team’s main objective is to position the Hubert Curien Laboratory as a laboratory of excellence on the European scale by encouraging both fundamental and applied research and developing interdisciplinary projects.",
