  "description": "Reseller hosting has always been advantageous for the people who wanted to sell web hosting. The reseller purchases the host's services wholesale and then sells them to customers, in pursuit of a profit. Reseller web hosting is a form of web hosting where the account holder has the ability to use his/her allotted hard drive space and bandwidth to host websites.

This set-back could always be overcome by upgrading one’s website.\r\n\r\nRead more information @ http://www.resellerhosts.in/",
