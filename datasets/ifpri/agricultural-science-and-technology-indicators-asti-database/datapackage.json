The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "Policymakers increasingly recognize greater investment in agricultural research as an essential element in raising agricultural productivity. Data on the size and scope of research capacity and investments, as well as on the changing institutional structure and functioning of agricultural research agencies, enhance our understanding of how agricultural research agencies, enhance our understanding of how agricultural research promotes agricultural growth. Indicators derived from such information allow the performance, inputs, and outcomes of agricultural research systems to be measured, monitored, and benchmarked. IFPRI's Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative is one of the few sources of statistics and other information on agricultural research in low and middle-income countries. ASTI provides comprehensive quantitative and qualitative information on and analyses of investment, capacity, and institutional trends in agricultural research. ASTI data and analyses help research managers a nd policymakers improve policy formulation and decision making at the national regional, and international levels. All outputs are availabale on the ASTI website (www.asti.cgiar.org).",
