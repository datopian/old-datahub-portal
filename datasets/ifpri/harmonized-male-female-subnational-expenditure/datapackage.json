The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

Our poverty calculations are based on the comparison between the household per-capita consumption expenditure (a synthetic indicator expressing the money-metric welfare utility level) and the $1.90 and $3.10/day poverty lines expressed in international equivalent purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars in 2011. Poverty headcount with standard deviation, gap, severity, and Gini index are also provided.",
