The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "This SAM is distinguished by an explicit separation of activities and households into rural and urban. It has a detailed treatment of aspects that are linked to the rural economy. Among the 45 activities, 38 are rural and 7 urban. Most rural sectors are part of crop or livestock agriculture. The non-agricultural sectors are classified as rural or urban. The SAM has 34 commodities, 14 factors of production, 4 households, a government account and two rest-of-the-world accounts, EU and non-EU. The distinction in the latter account permits an analysis of Morocco's regional trade (imports and exports) with the EU and the rest of the non-EU world.\r\nFor a description of the construction and use of this dataset, download the Trade and Macroeconomics Division Discussion Paper Number 41",
