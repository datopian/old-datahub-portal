The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "Data in the Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) database were collected in mid-2006 using four specific toolsâ€”document analysis of PPP related materials, semi-structured interviews with key informants engaged in PPP projects, an email survey of PPPs in 15 CGIAR centers, and development of a functional typology of PPPs. Each tool focused on obtaining data on the purpose, partners, outcomes, duration, and budgets of center PPPs that were active in 2004. In this database, PPPs are defined as any formal or informal arrangement between public and private sector entities to conduct research such as knowledge-sharing networks, technology financing, or subcontracted research. Please see the associated publications for further details.\r\nThis data was collected in 2006 and made it to Dataverse on 2015.",
