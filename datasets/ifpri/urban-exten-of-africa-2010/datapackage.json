    "description": "In collaboration with institutions throughout the world, IFPRI is often involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data. The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "Accurate delineation of the urban and rural areas has a broad range of implications on the quality and reliability of agricultural production and socio-economic statistics, design of household survey, establishment of agricultural development strategies and policies, and effective resource allocation. Two most widely-used urban/rural mapping dataset across Africa, GRUMP (Global Rural and Urban Mapping Project; http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/grump-v1) and SAGE Urban Extents (https://nelson.wisc.edu/sage/data-and-models/schneider.php), uses the underlying datasets of 2000-2002. There are various pilot studies attempting to update the dataset in major metropolitan areas or specific countries, but no African continent-wide effort has been made to date. To address this, using the GRUMP 2000 data as the baseline, we used a set of recently-published datasets to identify the newly extended urban areas across Africa. Three main data sources were the nightlights data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) 2010-2013, WorldPop 2010, and the MODIS Global Land Cover 2010-2013. Country-level urban population headcounts and their share of total population were acquired from the World Bank for 2010-2013 and used to control the total size of the urban population from the analysis is consistent with the statistics data at 1 km resolution.",
