The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "The aggregated and disaggregated Brazil Social Accounting Matrices for 1995-96 are primarily based on the 1995 Input-Output Table and National Accounts for Brazil, as well as the 1995-96 Agricultural Census. The disaggregated SAM has a total of 119 accounts. This SAM is characterized by its disaggregation of agricultural production activities by region (Amazon, Northeast, Center-west, and South and Southeast) and farm size (small and large). The aggregated version is based on the disaggregated SAM. It has a total of 71 accounts; agricultural activities and factors are not disaggregated by region. For a description of the construction and use of these SAMs, see Research Report #129, Balancing Agricultural Development and Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.",
