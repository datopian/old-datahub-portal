    "description": "In collaboration with institutions throughout the world, IFPRI is often involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data. The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey (PRHPS) 2012, Round 1.5 is a sub-sample consisting of agricultural households captured in Round 1 of the panel survey. It covers information of households, who either managed or cultivated agricultural plots, during the production year 2011-12, and two crop seasons, namely: (i) Kharif 2011; (ii) Rabi 2011-12. The survey gathers information on agricultural production (including inputs and outputs of crop and livestock production), agricultural water use, farm and household assets, access to extension services, climate change, credit, employment and income, household consumption and expenditures, and the linkage between pesticides and health. This survey covers 942 agricultural households in 76 primary sampling units in the rural areas of three provinces namely: (i) Punjab; (ii) Sindh; and (iii) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). The sample is nationally representative of the rural areas of the three provinces. Data was collected using a questionnaire based on discussion among IFPRI, PSSP and IDS staff and feedback from enumerators.",
