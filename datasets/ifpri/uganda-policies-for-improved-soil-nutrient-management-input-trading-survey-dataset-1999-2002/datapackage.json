  "notes": "The objective of the project has been to assess the impact of different casual factors and identify effective policy strategies to combat soil nutrient depletion problem in the highlands of Uganda. The research has utilized market, community, and household surveys to measure the impact of past and present policies on soil nutrient management in the Ugandan highlands; and developed market and household level models based on the surveys to evaluate the impact of alternative policy options. This survey is one of the three surveys conducted to analyze the market â€“ land degradation linkages. A total of 148 input traders were sampled, which, due to the thinness of Ugandan input markets, included all licensed traders in most of the regions.",
