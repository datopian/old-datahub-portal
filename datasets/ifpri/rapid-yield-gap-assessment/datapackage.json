    "description": "In collaboration with institutions throughout the world, IFPRI is often involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data. The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "Yield gap of nine priority commodities of the African Development Bank was assessed and aggregated at two levels across the Africa continent: 1) agro-ecological zones and 2) agro-ecological zones by country. In this rapid assessment, the yield gap was defined as the percentage difference between the actual yield estimated from spatially-disaggregated crop production statistics database and the potential yield retrieved from the FAO's Global Agro-Ecological Zones database, both at the 10-km pixel level.",
