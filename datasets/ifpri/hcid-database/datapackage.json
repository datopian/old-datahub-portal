    "description": "In collaboration with institutions throughout the world, IFPRI is often involved in the collection of primary data and the compilation and processing of secondary data. The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "HCID is a global grid identification system offering users to refer the location and boundary of a grid cell, available at multiple spatial resolutions, using a single integer number. Instead of using the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of two corners of the grid cell bounding box (i.e., upper-left and lower-right), we assign each grid cell with a sequential integer number, or a grid cell ID, unique to each spatial resolution. This system was developed by HarvestChoice (http://harvestchoice.org) and is being widely used to facilitate analysis of spatial data layers, including the visualization, domain analysis, spatial aggregation/dis-aggregation, and general exchange of spatially-explicit data across disciplines - without needing to use a GIS software and spatial analysis skills. For the five arc-minute resolution of grids, we call the ID system as \"CELL5M\", whereas ones for 30 arc-second, 30-minute and 1 degree are called CELL30S, CELL30M and CELL1D, respectively. Assigning 0 starting at the upper-left corner (longitude: -180.0, latitude: 90.0) with a geographic projection, for example, CELL5M ranges up to 9,331,199 at the lower-right corner (longitude: 180.0, latitude: -90.0). The grid cell ID at a specific location can be easily computed mathematically, and this can be also easily converted to different resolutions.",
