The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "Resilience of food security in the arid and semi-arid lowlands (ASAL) in Kenya, were assessed using repeated cross-sectional data (collected in 1993, 1998, 2003, and 2008). We measure short- and long-term food security in response to changing agro-climatic conditions, using indicators of child and woman nutritional status. Since measurements over time on the same units of analysis are not available, synthetic cohorts of individuals (children and women) having similar characteristics have been reconstructed, resulted in a pseudo-panel dataset. The dataset is used to observe resilience to agro-climatic shocks, including temperature increases, drought, and changes in vegetation cover.",
