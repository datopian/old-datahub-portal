The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "This dataset is a result of household surveys conducted in two major cotton producing districts, Lira and Kasese, in Uganda. The information were mainly collected on household characteristics, cotton production and current practices. The cotton producing villages were identified with the help of local extension agents. Out of these cotton produ cing villages, three villages in Lira and seven in Kasese were selected. A total of 150 household heads were interviewed, 30 in Lira and 120 in Kasese. These households were selected randomly from a list of producers provided by a ginneries operating in each district. The number of households selected from a village followed a qualitative evaluation by local extension agents of cotton produced in in each village. The information was primarily collected for 2007 growing season. Some additional information was also collected for 2006 growing season.",
