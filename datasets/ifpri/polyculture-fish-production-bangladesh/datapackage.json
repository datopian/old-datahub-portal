The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "This dataset provides information on the impact of commercial vegetable and polyculture fish production on income, household resource allocation, and nutrition in Bangladesh. The questionnaire was administered to 5,541 individuals in 955 rural households in 47 villages in four rounds from June, 1996 through September, 1997. The data were collected as part of an impact evaluation of new agricultural technologies being disseminated through NGOs. Topics in the household survey include income, household value of consumed goods; social capital; shock history; credit given and obtained; inheritance/assets at wedding/divorce; family background; health care and birth control use; household sanitation behavior; reproductive history and mortality; nutrition knowledge; food preferences; women's autonomy and decision making. Topics in the community survey include temperature and rainfall.\r\n\r\nThis dataset, along with the KwaZulu-Natal Income Dynamics Survey dataset and the Strengthening and Evaluation of the Hogares Comunitarios Program in Guatemala City dataset, were collected with the objective of examining to what extent intrahousehold allocation processes would affect the outcome of development policies, with particular emphasis on gender as a determinant of intrahousehold allocation. Because the data were designed to make some analyses comparable across countries, several modules are similar for all three datasets. The common modules include: information on assets at marriage of husband and wife, family background information, individual education and anthropometric data. Other modules are different because each country study has a different emphasis.",
