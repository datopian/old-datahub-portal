The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "This dataset is the baseline survey for the impact evaluation of the World Bank-funded program: the PSAOP (Programme de Services Agricoles et Organisations de Producteurs) in Senegal. The objective of this program was to strengthen the Rural Producers Organizations (POs) capacities to provide services for their members. The program also created PO councils at the district level “Communautés Rurales” in Senegal, through which the organizations can exchange information on their experiences.\r\n\r\nThe sampling design included several independent strata meant to reflect different agro-ecological areas in the Bassin Arachidier, the Niayes, and the Senegal River Valley. Within each district, 14 villages were randomly selected. When the number of villages in the district was less than 14, all villages were included in the sample and additional villages were eventually selected in larger districts. Four series of questionnaires were used: village-level; household-level; PO-level; and specific PO activities Topics covered are information at the village level; basic information on all households in the community, including their participation in the different POs in the village; information on all POs in the village (with a limit of five), and on collective field, cattle-breeding, trade, horticulture, irrigated perimeters management, and fishing when such activities were undertaken by the POs.",
