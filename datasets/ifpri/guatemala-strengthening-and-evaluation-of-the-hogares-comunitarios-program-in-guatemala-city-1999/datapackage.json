  "notes": "This survey was designed to provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the operations and impact of the Hogares Comunitarios program, a day care program under the auspices of the office of the First Lady of Guatemala. Two surveys were carried out: a random sample of 1340 households in one municipio of Guatemala City; and an impact evaluation sample of 550 households divided into participating and control households. Topics in the random sample survey include mother's income and employment status and history; assets; social capital; literacy and schooling; children under seven and mother's anthropometry; household composition, child care arrangements; family history; and hygiene spot check. Topics in the impact evaluation sample survey include household income; employment; household value of consumed goods; assets; social capital; literacy and schooling; morbidity of children 2-5 years old; anthropometry of 2-5 year olds and mother; household composition; child care arrangements; hamily history; hygiene spot check; house construction material; availability of water, sanitation, garbage-removal services; and child's diet.\r\n\r\nThis dataset, along with the KwaZulu-Natal Income Dynamics Survey dataset and the Bangladesh Commercial Vegetable and Fish Polyculture Production dataset, were collected with the objective of examining to what extent intrahousehold allocation processes would affect the outcome of development policies, with particular emphasis on gender as a determinant of intrahousehold allocation. Because the data were designed to make some analyses comparable across countries, several modules are similar for all three datasets. The common modules include: information on assets at marriage of husband and wife, family background information, individual education and anthropometric data. Other modules are different because each country study has a different emphasis. See Table 1 (PDF 65K) for a comparison of these datasets.",
