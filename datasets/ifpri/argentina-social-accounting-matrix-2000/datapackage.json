  "notes": "The Argentina SAM is based, mainly, on the disaggregation of the sectors of the 1997 Argentina Input-Output Matrix (MIPA 97) built by Argentina’s Statistics and Census Institute (INDEC). This 124x124 matrix constitutes the best input-output matrix built in Argentina. Since the MIPA 97 shows the transactions of the whole Argentine economy, the disaggregation process was focused on the opening of the agri-food sectors, and the aggregation of some sectors, which were of no interest for the analysis being carried on. The disaggregation and opening process had two parts. On the first place the disaggregation or opening of the MIPA 97 was made using cost structures for the year 1997. Then, once the new matrix’s technical coefficients were obtained, the upgrade to the year 2000 was done.",
