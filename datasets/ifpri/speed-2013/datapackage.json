The resulting datasets provide a wealth of information at the local (household and community), national, and global levels. IFPRI freely distributes as many of these datasets as possible and encourages their use in research and policy analysis. This group reflects the collection of IFPRI datasets.",

  "notes": "The dataset contains public expenditure data for 147 countries and 8 sectors: agriculture, communication, education, health, defense, mining, social protection, transport, transportation and communication (as a group) for the time period 1980-2010.\r\n\r\nIFPRI researchers have compiled data from multiple sources, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and national governments, and conducted extensive data checks and adjustments to ensure consistent spending measurements over time that are free of exchange-rate fluctuations and currency denomination changes.\r\n\r\nSPEED is a user friendly tool that could help governments to better allocate their resources to be consistent with their policy objectives, and citizensâ€™ needs and priorities. Because of the wide coverage of time periods, countries, and sectors, it could help policy makers and researchers to better understand the linkages between different types of public expenditure and development. It could also help examine historical trends and compare those to other countries.\r\n\r\nSPEED is funded by the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM).",
