  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\n[Background page](http://cdiac.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ushcn/background.html) states:\r\n\r\n> The United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) is a high-quality data set of daily and monthly records of basic meteorological variables from 1218 observing stations across the 48 contiguous United States. Daily data include observations of maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation amount, snowfall amount, and snow depth; monthly data consist of monthly-averaged maximum, minimum, and mean temperature and total monthly precipitation. Most of these stations are U.S. Cooperative Observing Network stations located generally in rural locations, while some are National Weather Service First-Order stations that are often located in more urbanized environments. The USHCN has been developed over the years at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to assist in the detection of regional climate change. Furthermore, it has been widely used in analyzing U.S. climte. The period of record varies for each station. USHCN stations were chosen using a number of criteria including length of record, percent of missing data, number of station moves and other station changes that may affect data homogeneity, and resulting network spatial coverage.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nAssumed open as from US government, but [Disclaimer](http://www.ornl.gov/ornlhome/disclaimers.shtml) page states:\r\n\r\n> Documents provided from the web server were sponsored by a contractor of the U.S. Government under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725.
