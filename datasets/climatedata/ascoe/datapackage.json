  "notes": "### About the data\r\n\r\nFrom project webpage:\r\n\r\n> The Atmospheric Chemistry Studies in the Oceanic Environment (ACSOE) programme was a 5-year NERC Community Research programme to investigate the physico-chemical processes occurring in the layer of atmosphere immediately above the oceans. It was developed from 1996 to 2000. The programme comprised a wide range of species and aerosol measurements coupled with integrated modelling studies. Measurements were made from April 1996 to December 1998 at remote field sites (Mace Head, Ireland; Weybourne, Norfolk; Tenerife); from the NERC research vessels Challenger and Discovery; using the Meteorological Research Flight C-130 aircraft and the Cranfield Jetstream aircraft.\r\n\r\n> The aims of the programme are to understand firstly the processes occurring in the remote marine atmosphere and secondly to discover how these are modified by anthropogenic emissions. The ACSOE study area extends from the cold water regions south of Iceland, through the temperate eastern Atlantic and North Sea, to the Canary Islands in the sub-tropical Atlantic.\r\n\r\n### Format\r\n\r\nASCII. NASA Ames Format, see http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/formats/NASA-Ames/ \r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nOn the one hand page advisors users to contact data providers, and stipulates noncommercial restrictions:\r\n\r\n> Users are strongly advised to contact the relevant data provider before making use of any particular data set. Users commit themselves to use the data for scientific purposes exclusively. In particular, they will not use them for any commercial or commercially related purpose. When using ACSOE data to support your study, you are kindly asked to acknowledge their provider(s) in any subsequent publication.\r\n\r\nOn the other, there is a note which says:\r\n\r\n> After a restricted access phase intended to protect the rights of ACSOE scientists, data have been progressively released to the public domain from January 2000 to July 2001, following a time chart specified in the ACSOE Implementation Plan. During the restricted access phase, data were only available to users subject to the terms and conditions of the ACSOE Data Protocol which aimed at encouraging rapid dissemination of scientific results while simultaneously protecting the rights of individual scientists. \r\n\r\nAlso indication that as of 2001 data is available under [ACSOE Data Protocol](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/acsoe/acsoe-protocol.html), which is 'aimed at encouraging rapid dissemination of scientific results while simultaneously protecting the rights of individual scientists'.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to clarify this.",
