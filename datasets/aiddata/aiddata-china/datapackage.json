    "description": "AidData is an online portal for information on development finance. AidData has developed the world's largest database of foreign aid projects, amounting to nearly $2 trillion in aid financed by 90+ donors between 1945 and 2012. AidData also offers innovative tools and applications for interacting with and analyzing foreign aid information, including project categorization (activity coding) and location (geocoding).\r\n\r\nAidData contains information from traditional aid sources such as the OECD's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) as well as donors not captured by the CRS and activities that do not fit the OECD definition of Official Development Assistance (ODA). In cooperation with the OECD CRS, AidData augments existing data by publishing more complete project descriptions and more detailed aid project purpose codes. In particular, AidData is dedicated to collecting project-level data from all multilateral donors and non-DAC bilateral donors (NDBs) to provide a more complete picture of development finance flows and activities.",

  "notes": "[From the project website] This project collects information on China’s foreign aid from the China Commerce Yearbook (中国商务年鉴) and the Almanac of China’s Foreign Economic Relations & Trade (中国对外经济贸易年间), published annually by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Data is reported for each year between 1990 and 2005, with the exception of 2002, in which year China’s Ministry of Commerce published no project-level data on its foreign aid giving.\r\n\r\nEach almanac/yearbook published by China’s Ministry of Commerce reports on several different components of Chinese aid giving. These components include such categories as number of medical teams dispatched (中国派遣医疗队), number of technical assistance projects aided by China (中圈援建成套项目技街合作情况), comprehensive projects assumed/undertaken (对外承担成 套项目), and comprehensive projects completed (对外援助成套项目建成). While these reports contain much interesting data, the only category for which project-level data was available was the “comprehensive projects completed” section of each report. Thus our dataset from 1990 to 2005 (excluding 2002) contains information taken exclusively from the “comprehensive projects completed” section of each year’s almanac.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that in reporting only “comprehensive projects completed” from the Ministry of Commerce almanacs from 1990 to 2005, this dataset represents only a small fraction of the total aid given by China. This, however, is the only project-level data we could obtain which was presented in a consistent and comprehensive manner over a period of years. We most certainly intend to supplement our existing dataset with further project-level data as it becomes available.\r\n\r\n### Data Details\r\n\r\nOriginal source: http://aiddata.org/research/china\r\n\r\n### Openness: OPEN?\r\n\r\nAssume this is under the main site license which just requires attribution: http://www.aiddata.org/help/cite",
