      "description": "This dataset is based on the donor-reported aid information captured in the Malawi Aid Management Platform (AMP), hosted by the Malawi Ministry of Finance. Using project documents, gathered from in-country donor offices during three missions to Lilongwe, the AidData and CCAPS teams added standardized geocodes using the UCDP/AidData methodology. In total, projects from 30 donor agencies were geocoded for 548 projects, representing $5.3 billion in total commitments (approximately 80% of the total external assistance to Malawi reported to the government from 2000-2011). It represents the first effort to sub-nationally geocode all donors in a single partner country, and the first initiative of the sort envisioned by the Open Aid Partnership, an initiative spearheaded by the World Bank to increase the openness and effectiveness of development assistance at the subnational level. An interactive map displaying these data along with data on armed conflict, governance, and climate security vulnerability can be viewed at www.strausscenter.org/ccaps/mappingtool.",

    "description": "AidData is an online portal for information on development finance. AidData has developed the world's largest database of foreign aid projects, amounting to nearly $2 trillion in aid financed by 90+ donors between 1945 and 2012. AidData also offers innovative tools and applications for interacting with and analyzing foreign aid information, including project categorization (activity coding) and location (geocoding).\r\n\r\nAidData contains information from traditional aid sources such as the OECD's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) as well as donors not captured by the CRS and activities that do not fit the OECD definition of Official Development Assistance (ODA). In cooperation with the OECD CRS, AidData augments existing data by publishing more complete project descriptions and more detailed aid project purpose codes. In particular, AidData is dedicated to collecting project-level data from all multilateral donors and non-DAC bilateral donors (NDBs) to provide a more complete picture of development finance flows and activities.",
