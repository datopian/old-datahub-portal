  "notes": "Open Plaques is an open source project (both code and data) has data on over three and a half thousand commemorative 'plaques' (often blue and round) that can be found across the UK.\r\n\r\nNew plaques are being added regularly and you browse the plaques by area, people, roles or organisations. Or see a list of all plaques.\r\n\r\nWhere available, the data for each plaque includes the:\r\n\r\n * Inscription\r\n * Person being commemorated\r\n * Geo location\r\n * Address / country\r\n * Organisation that created the plaque (around 250 so far) \r\n * Colour\r\n * Roles (e.g. author, inventor, actor, prime minister, namer of clouds etc.)\r\n * Verbs (e.g. lived, worked, died, visited, built, founded) that link the person to the location\r\n * Link to creative commons photo of plaque on Flickr\r\n\r\nMost of the page views on the site have .xml .json .kml views, just add the extension to the url.\r\n\r\nAnother very useful query is the 'box' query. Specify two geopoints, top-left and bottom-right and get returned all the plaques in that bounded box, e.g. http://openplaques.org/plaques.kml?box=[51.5482,-0.1617],[51.5282,-0.1217] or http://openplaques.org/plaques.json?box=[51.5482,-0.1617],[51.5282,-0.1217]\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nData is in the public domain. The [data page](http://www.openplaques.org/about/data) says:\r\n\r\n> We consider the data to be Public Domain, and make no claims of copyright over either the data we've collected ourselves, nor the value we've added to existing data.
