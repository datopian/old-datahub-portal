  "notes": "Data were collected from 10 participant samples from the following five countries: China, Colombia, Germany, Portugal, and USA.  In each country, we administered the die task to a sample of student participants (in universities) and a sample of participants from the general public (in coffee shops).  The task, adapted from Jiang (2013), was administered on iPads and was used assessed dishonesty.  Participants roll a (virtual) six-sided die, and each time, before rolling, were asked to select a side, either top or bottom, and keep it in mind.  They were instructed that they would earn a fixed amount of money (the equivalent of 10 cents USD) for every dot on the chosen side.  Participants then rolled the die and viewed the outcome, which displayed the number of dots on top and bottom.  They were then asked to report which side they had chosen.  In our study, participants repeated this task for 20 trials.  The HRProp variable represents the proportion of times that a participant selected the side with more favorable earnings after viewing the outcome.  These data were collected from Feb 2013-March 2014.",
