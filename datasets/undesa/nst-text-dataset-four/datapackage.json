  "notes": "The Tate Collection Here we present the metadata for around 70,000 artworks that Tate owns or jointly owns with the National Galleries of Scotland as part of ARTIST ROOMS. Metadata for around 3,500 associated artists is also included.\r\n\r\nThe metadata here is released under the Creative Commons Public Domain CC0 licence. Please see the enclosed LICENCE file for more detail.\r\n\r\nImages are not included and are not part of the dataset. Use of Tate images is covered on the Copyright and permissions page. You may also license images for commercial use.\r\n\r\nPlease review the full usage guidelines.\r\n\r\nRepository Contents\r\n\r\nWe offer two data formats:\r\n\r\nA richer dataset is provided in the JSON format, which is organised by the directory structure of the Git repository. JSON supports more hierarchical or nested information such as subjects.\r\n\r\nWe also provide CSVs of flattened data, which is less comprehensive but perhaps easier to grok. The CSVs provide a good introduction to overall contents of the Tate metadata and create opportunities for artistic pivot tables.",
