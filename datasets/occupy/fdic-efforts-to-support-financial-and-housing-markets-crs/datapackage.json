  "notes": "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was established as an independent \r\ngovernment corporation under the authority of the Banking Act of 1933, also known as the GlassSteagall Act (P.L. 73-66, 48 Stat. 162, 12 U.S.C.) to insure bank deposits. This report discusses \r\nrecent actions taken by the FDIC in support of housing and financial markets, including a \r\ntemporary increase in deposit insurance as required by the Emergency Economic Stabilization \r\nAct of 2008 (P.L. 110-343), the resolution of bank failures, the development of the Temporary \r\nLiquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), and efforts to reduce foreclosures. In addition, the report \r\ndiscusses the role of the FDIC in the Obama Administrationâ€™s Homeowner Affordability and \r\nStability Plan (HASP) announced on February 18, 2009, to help prevent 7 to 9 million \r\nforeclosures at a cost of $75 billion. \r\nThis report will be updated as events warrant",
