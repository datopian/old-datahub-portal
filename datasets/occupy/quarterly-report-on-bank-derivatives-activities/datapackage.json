  "notes": "\r\nEach quarter, based on information from the Reports of Condition and Income (call reports) filed by all insured U.S. commercial banks and trust companies as well as other published financial data, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prepares a report. That report describes what the call report information discloses about banks' derivative activities.\r\nThe current report focuses on OTC derivatives, and discusses key risk areas and performance. Additionally, a Glossary, Graphs and Tables are provided for further detail. Selecting the Quarter you are interested in from the list below will take you to the Executive Summary page for that quarter. From that page you may select one of the bookmarks on the side or you may read the report sequentially by either scrolling down the page or by using the navigation icons in the Adobe Acrobat reader.\r\nFor fact sheets between fourth quarter of 1995 and first quarter of 1998, the text of any quarter's fact sheet is available for printing section by section. Beginning with the second quarter of 1998 fact sheets are prepared using Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format and you will need the Adobe Acrobat reader to view them. The Acrobat Reader is available for download free from Adobe in versions for different platforms. Tables and graphs within the fact sheet are downloadable from the table of contents of the .pdf file.\r\nUnderlying data are provided back to the fourth quarter of 1998.\r\n",
