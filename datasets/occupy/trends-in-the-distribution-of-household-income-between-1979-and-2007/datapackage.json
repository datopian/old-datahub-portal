  "notes": "This Congressional Budget Office (CBO) study—prepared at the request of the Chairman and former Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance—documents changes \r\nin the distribution of household income between 1979 and 2007. CBO’s analysis examines \r\nthe distribution of household income before and after government transfers and federal taxes, \r\nand it reports the contribution of various income components (such as wages and salaries, \r\ncapital income, and business income) to the distribution of market income. The study presents information on trends in the distribution of income for all households combined and for \r\nhouseholds separated on the basis of age and the presence of children. In keeping with CBO’s \r\nmandate to provide objective, impartial analysis, this study makes no recommendations.\r\nEdward Harris and Frank Sammartino of CBO’s Tax Analysis Division wrote the study. Greg \r\nAcs, Nabeel Alsalam, Mark Hadley, Jon Schwabish, and David Weiner, all of CBO, provided \r\nhelpful comments, as did Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan and Tom DeLeire \r\nand Tim Smeeding of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The assistance of external \r\nreviewers implies no responsibility for the final product, which rests solely with CBO.\r\nChristine Bogusz edited the study, and Sherry Snyder proofread it. Jeanine Rees prepared the \r\nstudy for publication, and Maureen Costantino designed the cover. Monte Ruffin printed the \r\ninitial copies, and Linda Schimmel coordinated the print distribution. The study is available \r\non CBO’s Web site (www.cbo.gov).",
