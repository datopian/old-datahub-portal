      "description": "Regulations implementing the lobbyist bundling disclosure provisions of the Honest Leadership and Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA) took effect March 19. The new rules require disclosure of contributions bundled by lobbyists, registrants (with the Secretary of Senate and the Clerk of the House) and the PACs of lobbyists and registrants.  The reports listed below disclose the total amount of bundled contributions received in each covered period. Reports filed in July and January may include activity from two covered periods-(1) the committee's regular quarterly or monthly reporting period, the pre-election covered period, or the post-election covered period; and (2) the semi-annual covered period.  In addition, reports include, for each lobbyist/registrant or lobbyist/registrant PAC that forwards, or is credited with raising more than $16,000 in bundled contributions during the covered period, the bundler's name, address and the aggregate amount of contributions bundled during the covered period. The reports will also include any refunds of these bundled contributions.  ",
