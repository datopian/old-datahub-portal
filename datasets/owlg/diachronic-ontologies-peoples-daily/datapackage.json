Language Source Description This diachronic ontology is constructed from People's Daily of fifty years (i.e., from 1947 to 1996). The ontology for each year is consisted with several concept trees and we only consider words with frequencies not lower than 100 in each year. Numerals, punctuations, non-morpheme words, quantifiers and function words are excluded. In addition, we have subjectively defined eight eras of consecutive years. The ontology for each era only includes words with frequencies over 300 for each period. This language resource is established and maintained by the research group of Dr. Junfeng Hu in ICL Peking University. Updates and modifications will be unloaded and announced in the KLCL website (www.klcl.pku.edu.cn). 2.
