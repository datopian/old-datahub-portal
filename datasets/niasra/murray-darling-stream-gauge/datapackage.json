  "notes": "Description\r\n---------------\r\nThis dataset was produced and is hosted by CSIRO Australia. The following description is taken directly from the CSIRO data portal website:\r\n\r\nThese four NetCDF databases constitute the bulk of the spatial and spatiotemporal environmental covariates used in a latent health factor index (LHFI) model for assessment and prediction of ecosystem health across the MDB. The data formatting and hierarchical statistical modelling were conducted under a CSIRO appropriation project funded by the Water for a Healthy Country Flagship from July 2012 to June 2014. Each database was created by collating and aligning raw data downloaded from the respective state government websites (QLD, NSW, VIC, and SA). (ACT data were unavailable.) There are two primary components in each state-specific database: (1) a temporally static data matrix with axes \"Site ID\" and \"Variable,\" and (2) a 3D data cube with axes \"Site ID\", \"Variable,\" and \"Date.\" Temporally static variables in (1) include geospatial metadata (all states), drainage area (VIC and SA only), and stream distance (SA only). Temporal variables in (2) include discharge, water temperature, etc. Missing data (empty cells) are highly abundant in the data cubes. The attached state-specific README.pdf files contain additional details on the contents of these databases, and any computer code that was used for semi-automation of raw data downloads.",
