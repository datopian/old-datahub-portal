  "notes": "**The dataset contains fictitious information and was created for testing and evaluation of visual analytic tools only. No part of this dataset should be taken as real.**\r\n\r\nIt is Fall of 2004 and one of your analyst colleagues has been called away from her current tasks to an emergency. The boss has given you the assignment of picking up her investigation and completing her task. She has been asked to pursue a line of investigation into some unexpected activities concerning wildlife law enforcement, endangered species issues, and ecoterrorism. This isn't exactly your specialty area, but your boss believes you are one of the few people who could get to the bottom of whatever is going on. In fact, you would have been given this investigation if you hadn't been busy on another assignment when your colleague had started. Your colleague hasn't gotten very far, but she has assembled all the data relevant to this case. It is a mixed assortment of information: text, images, numbers. The agency you work for is very accommodating -- you may use any analytical tool you need to help your investigations.",
