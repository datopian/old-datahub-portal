  "title": "3DSEM: A 3D Microscopy Dataset",
  "description": "The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) as 2D imaging instrument has been widely used in biology and material sciences to determine the surface attributes of microscopic specimens. However the SEM micrographs still remain 2D images. To effectively measure and visualize the surface properties, we need to restore the shape model from the SEM images. Having 3D surfaces from SEM images would provide true anatomic shape of microscopic objects which allow for quantitative measurements and informative visualization of the system being investigated.The 3D Microscopy Dataset which is provided here includes both 2D images and 3D reconstructed surfaces of several biological material samples. To get the data and know about \"Term Of Usage\", please visit http://selibcv.org/3dsem/",
