The Center also supports and cooperates with the National Science Council’s \"The Sustainable Management of Taiwan Digital Archives Project\". Academia Sinica’s institutes and centers have been engaged in a long-term endeavor to apply information technology to the archiving of precious cultural heritage, historical documents, archaeological discoveries, biological specimens, and a wide variety of photographic images stored at Academia Sinica, as well as developing related digital information and web technology. These efforts have resulted in the accumulation of over a million digital collections and the construction of nearly one hundred websites and databases, all of which represents immense potential for future development and utilization.",
