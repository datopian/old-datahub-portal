The Standard Deviations (SD) away is the new score.\r\nThus, all variables could be averaged for a simple version of the “human development index”\r\n\r\nI reversed the signs for Infant Mortality Rate, so high would be good, which was comparable to education and GDP per capita.\r\nFreedom originally is scored so low = more freedom. Thus, I also reversed the signs for freedom too.\r\n\r\n\r\nData sources: \r\n\r\nRegion and Area definition\r\nUnited Nations. Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Population Division.

You may extract, download, and make copies of the information contained in the Datasets, and you may share that information with third parties.\r\nhttp://go.worldbank.org/OJC02YMLA0\r\n\r\nNOTE: average years of schooling correlates .7 to .9 with percent of people with no education\r\nIt also generally correlates highly with percent who finished primary, secondary and tertiary schools\r\n\r\nThe worldbank data does not provide \"world\" estimates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld happiness report\r\nhttp://worldhappiness.report/\r\nI used 2015 data. The website says, about the 2016 report:\r\nThis publication may be reproduced using the following reference:\r\nHelliwell, J., Layard, R., & Sachs, J. (2016). World Happiness Report 2016, Update (Vol. I). New York: Sustainable Development Solutions Network.\r\nWorld Happiness Report management by Sharon Paculor and Anthony Annett, copy edit by Jill Hamburg Coplan, Aditi Shah and Saloni Jain, design by John Stislow and Stephanie Stislow, cover design by Sunghee Kim.\r\nFull text and supporting documentation can be downloaded from the website: http://worldhappiness.report/#happiness2016\r\nISBN 978-0-9968513-3-6 Volume I\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Happiness  FAQ page http://worldhappiness.report/faq/ the scores are based on responses to questions from the Gallup World Poll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDP Human Development Index (HDI)\r\nFrom the UNDP Human Development Report.\r\nhttp://hdr.undp.org/en/2014-report/download\r\nAccording to the terms of use page, we are free to share, redistribute, etc, as long as we give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\r\nhttp://hdr.undp.org/en/content/copyright-and-terms-use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedom in the World (PR and CL)\r\nhttp://www.freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world\r\nData copyright by the Freedom House, included here by permission\r\nAny use of these data should include citation to the Freedom House\r\n1972 data for South Africa is from 1973\r\nData are included for 1990 and 1995 because former USSR data only start after 1990. No data before that.\r\nHowever, there is data for USSR up through 1990.\r\n\r\n\"PR\" stands for \"Political Rights,\" \"CL\" stands for \"Civil Liberties,\" and \"Status\" is the Freedom Status.\r\nPolitical Rights and Civil Liberties are measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree of Freedom and seven the lowest.\r\n“F,” “PF,” and “NF,” respectively, stand for “Free,” “Partly Free,” and “Not Free.”\r\nUntil 2003, countries whose combined average ratings for Political Rights and for Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated \"Free\"; between 3.0 and 5.5 “Partly Free,\" and between 5.5 and 7.0 “Not Free.”\r\nBeginning with the ratings for 2003, countries whose combined average ratings fall between 3.0 and 5.0 are \"Partly Free,\" and those between 5.5 and 7.0 are \"Not Free.\"\r\nRatings for territories are not included in this table.\r\nSeveral countries became independent, split into two or more countries, or merged with a neighboring  state. Scores for these countries are given only for the period of their existence as independent states.\r\n*These refer to the various editions ofFreedom in the World, except for Jan.-Feb. 1973 through Jan.-Feb. 1977, which are from the bimonthly journalFreedom at Issue.\r\nThe firstFreedom in the Worldbook-length survey was the 1978 edition.\r\nFor 1972, South Africa was rated as “White” (2,3 Free) and “Black” (5,6 Not Free).\r\nFor Yugoslavia, ratings from 1999 to 2002 were for the country that remained following the departures between 1991 and 1992 of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\r\nIn February 2003, the Yugoslav parliament adopted a constitutional charter establishing the state of Serbia and Montenegro. Thus, beginning in 2003, Yugoslavia is listed as \"Serbia and Montenegro.\"\r\nThe State Union of Serbia and Montenegro dissolved when Montenegro withdrew in June 2006, making Serbia an independent state. Thus, the ratings for Serbia and Montenegro are listed separately beginning in 2006.\r\nKosovo was first listed as a  territory beginning in 1992. Since 2009, it is listed as an independent country.\r\nSouth Sudan was first listed as an independent country in 2011 after officially separating from Sudan in July 2011.\r\nThe former Zaire is listed under Congo (Kinshasa), and the former Western Samoa is listed under Samoa.\r\n",
