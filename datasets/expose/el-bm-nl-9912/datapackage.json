    "description": "The Parliamentary Proceedings of a country provide a backbone of its textual cultural heritage. It covers centuries, in a standardized format, with highly controlled quality. Its completeness as a longitudinal corpus and its content covering a large part of a nations history, makes the proceedings both of interest in their own right, and as a tool to contextualize other data collections. The Dutch Parliamentary Proceedings are available in digitized format starting from 1576 (although large parts of 1625-1815 have not been digitized). However, access is poor as it is limited to full text search of OCR'ed text editions, or metadata descriptions of the archives. The main issues and the main research problems of the proposal are: How to turn the corpus of digitized heritage texts into a connected network of information? How to exploit the obtained networked structure for interactive exploratory search?\r\n\r\nThe ExPoSe project aims to bring out the full potential of the Dutch Proceedings by transforming them into a structured XML format. To really function as a backbone, it must be easy to connect other documents deeply into the proceedings. We make this possible by connecting the content of the Proceedings to the Linked Open Data cloud, which we extend with several historically relevant sources (among them the huge newspaper collection of the Royal Library of the Netherlands and the _Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal_, WNT). The project will run for 5 years with a consortium that covers the whole chain from raw data producer to end-users in the Creative Industry. ",

A Hybrid Approach to Domain-Specific Entity Linking. _Proceedings of the Posters and Demos Track of the 11th International Conference on Semantic Systems_. The benchmark consists of a sample of Dutch parliamentary proceedings from the period 1999-2014, _gold standard_ annotations, EL system annotations, and accompanying code.\r\n\r\n##Software##\r\nThe [accompanying code](https://bitbucket.org/aolieman/pm_el_tools/) is hosted on Bitbucket, and is largely self-documenting. Some additional documentation is kept in the [project wiki](https://bitbucket.org/aolieman/pm_el_tools/wiki/browse/).\r\n\r\n##Annotation Guidelines##\r\nWe provide the [Dutch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ufgFltfocQk-6oHDsT1fOzv6rIMRewxo-HJOoIShiYY/) original and an\r\n[English translation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vcW-fHEYPqYQpKNiqaIs4xAbOoNkz1Pb3k3qpYvGqA8/) of the gold standard annotation guidelines that were used to produce this benchmark.\r\n\r\n##Datasets##\r\nThe files in this dataset are provided in the [MongoDB Extended JSON](http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/reference/mongodb-extended-json/) format, which allows them to be conveniently imported with [mongoimport](http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/reference/program/mongoimport/#bin.mongoimport), and used with the provided code.\r\n\r\nThe gold standard and system annotations will also be made available as [NIF](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/specification/core.html), for usage with existing EL benchmarking frameworks.
