  "notes": "Federal Reserve data on emergency lending to banks covering the period August 2007 to April 2010 released in batches in Dec 2010, March 2011 and July 2011 as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and FOIA requests by Bloomberg news and others.\r\n\r\nFrom the [Bloomberg page about the data (Aug 2011)][bloomberg-processing]:\r\n\r\n> The data were extracted from 29,000 pages of documents and 18 Fed-prepared Microsoft Excel spreadsheets listing more than 21,000 transactions. The records were made public in batches on Dec. 1, 2010, and March 31 and July 6 of this year. The Fed released some of them under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and the rest in responses to Freedom of Information Act requests by media outlets including Bloomberg News and related federal court orders. The data covered money borrowed from the central bank from August 2007 through April 2010.\r\n\r\n * [Bloomberg News visualization using consolidated data][bloomberg-viz] (NB: as far as one can tell Bloomberg have not released their consolidated database. [Details of data processing][bloomberg-processing]).\r\n\r\n[bloomberg-viz]: http://www.bloomberg.com/data-visualization/federal-reserve-emergency-lending\r\n[bloomberg-processing]: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-21/fed-data-from-29-000-pages-show-banks-borrowings-methodology.html\r\n\r\n### Data Source\r\n\r\nFrom [Bloomberg Story][]:\r\n\r\n[Bloomberg Story]: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/federal-reserve-releases-discount-window-loan-records-under-court-order.html\r\n\r\n> The Federal Reserve released thousands of pages of secret loan documents under court order, almost three years after Bloomberg LP first requested details of the central bank’s unprecedented support to banks during the financial crisis.\r\n>\r\n> The records reveal for the first time the names of financial institutions that borrowed directly from the central bank through the so-called discount window. The Fed provided the documents after the U.S. Supreme Court this month rejected a banking industry group’s attempt to shield them from public view.\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n>\r\n> The central bank has never revealed identities of borrowers since the discount window began lending in 1914. The Dodd-Frank law exempted the facility last year when it required the Fed to release details of emergency programs that extended $3.3 trillion to financial institutions to stem the credit crisis. While Congress mandated disclosure of discount-window loans made after July 21, 2010 with a two-year delay, the records released today represent the only public source of details on discount- window lending during the crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nLicense: presuming public domain as data released from a federal agency.",
