  "notes": "Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR database which contains\r\nregulatory filings from publicly-traded US corporations.\r\n\r\n> All companies, foreign and domestic, are required to file registration\r\n> statements, periodic reports, and other forms electronically through EDGAR.\r\n> Anyone can access and download this information for free. Here you'll find\r\n> links to a complete list of filings available through EDGAR and instructions\r\n> for searching the EDGAR database.\r\n\r\n## Human Interface\r\n\r\nSee http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html\r\n\r\n## Bulk Data\r\n\r\nEDGAR provides bulk access via FTP: ftp://ftp.sec.gov/ - [official\r\ndocumentation][ftp-doc]. We summarize here the main points.\r\n\r\nEach company in EDGAR gets an identifier known as the CIK which is a 10 digit\r\nnumber. You can find the CIK by searching EDGAR using a name of stock market\r\nticker.\r\n\r\nFor example, [searching for IBM by\r\nticker](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=ibm) shows us that the the\r\nCIK is `0000051143`.\r\n\r\nNote that leading zeroes are often omitted (e.g. in the ftp access) so this\r\nwould be come `51143`.\r\n\r\nNext each submission receives an 'Accession Number' (acc-no). For example,\r\nIBM's quarterly financial filing (form 10-Q) in October 2013 had accession\r\nnumber: `0000051143-13-000007`.\r\n\r\n### FTP File Paths\r\n\r\nGiven a company with CIK (company ID) XXX (omitting leading zeroes) and\r\ndocument accession number YYY (acc-no on search results) the path would be:\r\n\r\nFile paths are of the form:\r\n\r\n    /edgar/data/XXX/YYY.txt\r\n\r\nFor example, for the IBM data above it would be:\r\n\r\n<ftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/data/51143/0000051143-13-000007.txt>\r\n\r\nNote, if you are looking for a nice HTML version you can find it at in the\r\nArchives section with a similar URL (just add -index.html):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51143/000005114313000007/0000051143-13-000007-index.htm\r\n\r\n### Indices\r\n\r\nIf you want to get a list of all filings you'll want to grab an Index. As the help page explains:\r\n\r\n> The EDGAR indices are a helpful resource for FTP retrieval, listing the\r\n> following information for each filing: Company Name, Form Type, CIK, Date\r\n> Filed, and File Name (including folder path).\r\n> \r\n> Four types of indexes are available:\r\n> \r\n> * company — sorted by company name\r\n> * form — sorted by form type\r\n> * master — sorted by CIK number\r\n> * XBRL — list of submissions containing XBRL financial files, sorted by CIK\r\n>   number; these include Voluntary Filer Program submissions\r\n\r\nURLs are like:\r\n\r\nftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/full-index/2008/QTR4/master.gz\r\n\r\nThat is, they have the following general form:\r\n\r\n    ftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/full-index/{YYYY}/QTR{1-4}/{index-name}.[gz|zip]\r\n\r\nSo for XBRL in the 3rd quarter of 2010 we'd do:\r\n\r\nftp://ftp.sec.gov/edgar/full-index/2010/QTR3/xbrl.gz\r\n\r\n[ftp-doc]: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/ftpusers.htm\r\n\r\n### CIK lists and lookup\r\n\r\nThere's a full list of all companies along with their CIK code here: http://www.sec.gov/edgar/NYU/cik.coleft.c\r\n\r\nIf you want to look up a CIK or company by its ticker you can do the following query against the normal search system:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=ibm&Find=Search&owner=exclude&action=getcompany&output=atom\r\n\r\nThen parse the atom to grab the CIK. (If you prefer HTML output just omit output=atom).\r\n\r\nThere is also a full-text company name to CIK lookup here:\r\nhttp://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/cik.htm (Note this does a POST to a 'text'\r\nAPI at http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/cik.pl.c)\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n* CorpWatch have an excellent API and DB dump covering a lot of EDGAR info - see the [CorpWatch DataHub Entry]\r\n\r\n[corpwatch]: http://datahub.io/dataset/corpwatch",
