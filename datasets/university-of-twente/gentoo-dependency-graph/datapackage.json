    "description": "The University of Twente is where talent can best realize its full potential. Students and staff are the key. Together, 3,300 scientists and professionals carry out ground-breaking research, bring about socially relevant innovation, and provide inspiring teaching for more than 9,000 students. To us, entrepreneurship comes as second nature. The campus is home to around 100 businesses, including student-run businesses. The University of Twente has also generated more than 700 successful spin-off companies. The university's business park, Kennispark Twente, encourages and assists entrepreneurs to start new companies. But there's so much more than that happening on our wonderful, green campus. Our sports and cultural facilities are unique and we host events such as the world's largest student think tank, Create Tomorrow. Another legend of the Twente campus is the Netherlands' largest student sports event, the Batavieren Race. The campus is a hive of activity - a truly inspirational place to be!",
