We have already reduced emissions by 21 percent â€“ equivalent to cutting emissions entirely from four cities the size of London.\r\n\r\nThe changes described in the Transion plan are a selection of additions to the law, investment in techonology and incentive schemes. \r\n\r\nThe changes are described by their affect on\r\n\r\n- Individuals\r\n- Agrigulture\r\n- Industry",
