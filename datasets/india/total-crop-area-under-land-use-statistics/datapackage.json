A web based application can be viewed at http://lus.dacnet.nic.in with four modules: Land Use Classifications, Source wise Irrigation, Crop wise Irrigation and Area under Crops. This application is being used to collect data on how the geographical land is being used under different classifications including irrigated area of different water sources, crop wise irrigated and un-irrigated area. The data is being used for study and analysis of land-use pattern, crop diversifications, impact of the different ongoing schemes on irrigation and crops, and for formulation of new schemes. Additionally it also facilitates study of Land Use Pattern, Percentage of Irrigation Availability for each crop and District Wise un-irrigated Crop Production. Various analytical reports include: Source Wise Irrigation, Percentage Availability of water from different sources for crop production and state wise including Time Series Report for Land Use Classification.",
