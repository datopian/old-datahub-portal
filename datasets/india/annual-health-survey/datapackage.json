      "description": "The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in collaboration with the Registrar General of India (RGI), had launched an Annual Health Survey (AHS) in the erstwhile Empowered Action Group States (Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattishgarh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan) and Assam. AHS provided District-wise data on Total Fertility Rate (TFR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) at the regional level. Other RCH indicators like Ante-natal care, Institutional delivery, immunization, use of contraceptives are also available. The aim of the survey was to provide feedback on the impact of the schemes under NRHM in reduction of Total Fertility Rate (TFR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) at the district level and the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) at the regional level by estimating these rates on an annual basis for around 284 districts in these States. The results of the first round of AHS for some of the indicators viz. Crude Birth Rate (CBR), Crude Death Rate (CDR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Neo-natal Mortality Rate, Under Five Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB), Sex Ratio (0-4 years) and Total Sex Ratio have been released by the Registrar General of India (RGI). The table consist district-wise data in respect of the above indicators for the nine States viz. Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattishgarh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and Assam.",
