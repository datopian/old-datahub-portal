In the dataset a detailed summary of Ammonia levels in the country has been furnished. The air quality of different cities/towns has been compared with the respective National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The air quality has been categorized into four broad categories based on an Exceedance Factor (the ratio of annual mean concentration of a pollutant with that of a respective standard). The four categories are low, moderate, high and critical levels. In addition, to above the spread of the data has been given in terms of standard deviation. The ambient air quality monitoring network comprises of 456 stations in 31 States and Union Territories. The data is sourced from National ambient air quality status & trends in India-2010.",
