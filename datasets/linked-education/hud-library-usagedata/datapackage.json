  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nCirculation and Recommendation data from the [University of Huddersfield Library](http://library.hud.ac.uk). Data is comprised of two parts:\r\n\r\n> **1. Circulation Data**. This breaks down the loans by year, by academic school, and by individual academic courses. This data will primarily be of interest to other academic libraries. UK academic libraries may be able to directly compare borrowing by matching up their courses against ours (using the UCAS course codes).\r\n\r\n> **2. Recommendation Data**. This is the data which drives the \"people who borrowed this, also borrowedâ€¦\" suggestions in our OPAC. This data had previously been exposed as a web service with a non-commercial licence, but is now freely available for you to download. We've also included data about the number of times the suggested title was borrowed before, at the same time, or afterwards.\r\n\r\nBackground information is available at [Dave Pattern's blog post](http://www.daveyp.com/blog/archives/528) of 2008-12-28.\r\n\r\n### Access/Re-use\r\n\r\nFully open.
