No exportable data.\r\n## Details\r\nAFD is the Groupe Agence Française de Développement, a bi-lateral development finance institution established in 1941 that works on behalf of the French government. Its mission is to finance development according to France’s Overseas Development Assistance policies.\r\nAFD is wholly owned by the French State. It is a public entity dedicated to activities of an industrial and commercial nature, and operates under the aegis of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Overseas Territories. AFD is endowed with €400 million, and manages a loan portfolio worth more than €10.44 billion as of the end of 2007.\r\nAFD traces its origins back to 1941 when General de Gaulle, having obtained refuge in London, founded an organization that was AFD’s direct predecessor: The Central Fund of Free France (Caisse centrale de la France libre or CCFL) was establish by the law of December 2nd.\r\nIn 2007, AFD committed over €3.5 billion to more than 60 developing countries in Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East, South America, and the French Overseas Territories. AFD uses a wide range of financial instruments to underwrite its activities: grants, subsidies, guarantees, loans, equity shareholdings, co-financing and local bank intermediation. AFD works hand-in-hand with many partners: national, regional and local governments; local authorities and municipalities; international agencies; non-governmental organizations; foundations; private companies; entrepreneurs; and local banks, microfinance institutions and capital markets.",
