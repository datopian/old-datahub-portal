So how to express toll plaza congestion level quantitatively and guide the toll collection manner rationally and effectively during the peak period becomes a focus of highway industry. Based on the video detection system of square queuing length detection, square queuing area occupancy rate and its change rate are obtained, then the traffic index algorithm is put forward, and the toll plaza passing index is divided into [0, 6]. Finally, the queuing area occupancy rate and traffic index, which are calculated from video detection system and index algorithm, are compared with the traffic flow data. These three data almost have the same change trend. As a result, the feasibility of the video detection scheme and index scheme is validated.\r\n",
