      "description": "Flying qualities of aerocraft are closely related to the performance of control system. Aimed at the roll stable aerocraft with rapid changing parameters, on the basis of analyzing the typical trajectory, and taking pitch control loop for an example, a three loop autopilots of roll stability, pitch and yaw were designed. The overload due to control surface transition deflection was avoided using single-mode Transient suppression method when control parameters were changed. The verification was done according to six freedom degrees non-linear simulation. The result showed that: under the action of disturbance torque, the phase margin of autopilot was greater than 30 °, the bandwidth was more than 14rad/s, the range of nominal trajectory was about 16km, the max height was about 5100m , the deviation of lateral was about 12m, and the response of overload could accurately track the given overload instruction. The effective range of the aerocraft was from 13.5km to 22.4km; the max deviation of lateral was about 42m; the maximum elevator deflection was less than 6.5°; and the control law was applicable within the effective range. A control system design method of aerocraft with rapid changing parameters was provided.",
