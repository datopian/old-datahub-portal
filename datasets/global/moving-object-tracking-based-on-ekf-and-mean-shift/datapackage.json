In this paper, Extend Kalman filter and Mean shift are combined to track the moving object. Firstly Extend Kalman filter is used to predict the next possible position of the object at target center. Secondly, mean shift is adapted to search moving target later. Experiment results show that this method reduces the time for searching object, thus it improves the speed of tracking target. \r\n \r\n",
