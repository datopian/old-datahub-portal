  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nIn October 2009 the Guardian [reported](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/14/london-developers-free-official-data) that there were plans to open up official data from the City of London.\r\n\r\n> The Greater London Authority is holding an event this month to ask developers how it can best make its data available for reuse â€“ a plan that resembles San Francisco's efforts to stimulate widespread use of local government information.\r\n\r\n> [...] The organisers say that the GLA \"is currently in the process of scoping London's DataStore. Initially we propose to release as much GLA data as possible and to encourage other public agencies in London to do the same and we'd like your help.\"\r\n\r\nMany datasets are available at:\r\n\r\n * <http://www.london.gov.uk/focusonlondon/datastore.jsp>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nOpen.
