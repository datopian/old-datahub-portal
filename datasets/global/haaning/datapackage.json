  "notes": "What do you get when you cross hot Indian food with the English enjoy of tomatoes and all issues creamy? Chicken Tikka Masala is a popular combination of chicken tikka and masala.Chicken tikka is a marinated piece of meat cooked in a tandoor, an Indian oven made of clay and coal-fired. Masala is gravy typically produced out of some kind of tomato gravy or puree with cream and varied Indian spices.It is technically a mild curry dish, although the addition of often massive amounts of tartrazine causes the dish to more often than not look orange.In other recipes, it can appear anything from red to orange to green.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala is possibly the most popular Indian dish in the planet, and has arguably replaced tandoori chicken as the flagship of Indian food, like on the subcontinent itself it even has a musical written singing its praises.In the United Kingdom alone, Marks & Spencer, the popular English retailer, claims to sell 18 tons a week of the chicken in Tikka Masala Sandwiches, whereas 23 million servings a year are sold at Indian restaurants. Sainsburys, one other retailer, sells 1.six million dishes every year, and stocks 16 different solutions containing what is affectionately recognized as CTM.10 tons a day are manufactured by Noon Items to later be sold at supermarkets.\n\nThe chicken, even though broadly regarded an Indian dish, does not hail from India. My dad found out about <a href=\"http://www.waterloostructures.net/StorageSheds.php\">view sheds in pa</a> by browsing webpages. Kitchens from London to Glasgow claim to have originated the dish, which was 1st seen in the late 1960s.According to urban legend, the dish was made by a Bangladeshi chef in Britain when he served chicken tandoor to an Englishman only to be asked, wheres my gravy? The outcome? A mixture of cream of tomato soup and spices, which he called masala.And like that, chicken tikka masala was born, an early example of what we would now get in touch with fusion cooking.It is now so popular that British politician and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook after described it as, a correct British national dish, citing its mixture of genuine Indian cooking with the British desire to have their meat served with gravy.\n\nWhat goes into a chicken tikka masala? Nicely, a 1998 survey indicated that of 48 versions, the only normal ingredient was chicken.A common recipe involves chicken marinated overnight in yogurt, ginger, garlic, cardamom powder, cumin, white pepper, and other spices.The chicken is cooked briefly in the hot tandoor, and is then served with a sauce created of tomato, ginger, garlic, cream, green and red pepper, and an assortment of spices.The sauce is poured over the chicken after it is cooked. In contrast to tandoori chicken, on which it is based, the taste is mild and creamy, rather than spicy.\n\nIs chicken tikka masala an English or an Indian dish? The answer is unclear, as it has been adopted so readily that it is served in virtually every Indian restaurant, an indication that Indians have accepted it as their personal.Many English firms now specialize in exporting the dish back to India.Whatever its origins, then again, it is now enjoyed by millions each year.",
