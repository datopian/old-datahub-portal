The corpus includes:\r\n\r\n * Over 1.8 million articles (excluding wire services articles that appeared during the covered period).\r\n * Over 650,000 article summaries written by library scientists.\r\n * Over 1,500,000 articles manually tagged by library scientists with tags drawn from a normalized indexing vocabulary of people, organizations, locations and topic descriptors.\r\n * Over 275,000 algorithmically-tagged articles that have been hand verified by the online production staff at nytimes.com.\r\n * Java tools for parsing corpus documents from .xml into a memory resident object.\r\n\r\n> As part of the New York Times' indexing procedures, most articles are manually summarized and tagged by a staff of library scientists. This collection contains over 650,000 article-summary pairs which may prove to be useful in the development and evaluation of algorithms for automated document summarization. Also, over 1.5 million documents have at least one tag. Articles are tagged for persons, places, organizations, titles and topics using a controlled vocabulary that is applied consistently across articles. For instance if one article mentions \"Bill Clinton\" and another refers to \"President William Jefferson Clinton\", both articles will be tagged with \"CLINTON, BILL\".\r\n\r\n> The New York Times has established a community website for researchers working on the data set at http://groups.google.com/group/nytnlp and encourages feedback and discussion about the corpus.\r\n\r\n### Access/re-use\r\n\r\nNot open.
