From <http://www.pti.org.uk/repository.htm>:\r\n\r\n> The third snapshot of the traveline data was taken in October 2006. It was based on the data that traveline was using in one week in October 2006.\r\n> \r\n> Guidance Notes were available to describe the data formats that were preferred for the submission. The data is still being processed.\r\n> \r\n> ...\r\n> \r\n> Access to the repository is at http://www.nptdr.org.uk/ and can also be accessed by ftp. Address: ftp://nptdr.org.uk (if this does not work try ftp://80.168.84.131). Look out for the pdf file \"Web Site User Guide\".\r\n> \r\n> A username and password is needed. One is being issued to each local authority and may be issued to anyone doing accessibility planning for a public sector client.\r\n> \r\n> If you need a password ask NPTDR Data Manager at Thales.\r\n\r\n### Openness: NOT OPEN\r\n\r\n  * License: need a license for commercial use [1].\r\n  * Access: access to download ftp site is restricted. Appears to be by ftp for those with requisite permissions.\r\n\r\n[1] according to <http://www.pti.org.uk/datausers.htm>:\r\n\r\n> NPTDR data is now being made available under commercial licence to those who are working on projects whether they are inside or outside the public sector.\r\n\r\nDiscussed at [Workshop on Public Information, 2008-11-02](http://okfn.org/wiki/PublicInformation).",
