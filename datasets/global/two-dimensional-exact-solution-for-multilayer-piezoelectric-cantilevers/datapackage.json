  "notes": "In our present paper, the plan strain theory of transversely isotropic bodies for studying a piezoelectric multi-layer cantilev er has been used, and also in order to find the general solution of a multi-layer piezoelectric cantilever the inverse method has been obtained. The stress and induction f unctions in the form of polynomials as well as the general solu tions of the beam have been obtained. Finally, based on the general solution we have deduced the solutions of the cantilever under different loading condit ions  http://www.ivypub.org/rms/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2339",
