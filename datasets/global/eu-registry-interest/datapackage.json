  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\n> By opening this voluntary Register, in the context of the European Transparency Initiative, the European Commission wishes to let citizens know which general or specific interests are influencing the decision-making process of the European Institutions and the resources mobilized to that end.

While registering, interest representatives commit themselves to the elements of the Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\n> This page offers direct access to interest representatives to register, update or prolong their registration as well as direct access for the public at large to all information available in the Register. It also offers the possibility to lodge a complaint related to a suspected violation of the Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\n> The European Commission will experiment with this instrument for one year; a period in which to test the practicalities of the register and gain valuable practical experience for the future.\r\n\r\nDetails include:\r\n\r\n * Interest representative\r\n * Category of activities\r\n * Head of the organisation\r\n * Contact details\r\n * Goals / remit\r\n * Fields of interest for e-mail alerts on consultations\r\n * Structure\r\n * Networking\r\n * Financial data\r\n * Interest representation activities\r\n\r\nAt time of writing (2009-04-22), there are 1341 interest representatives in the register.\r\n\r\n### Access\r\n\r\nAccess through a web interface, no bulk download available.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nFree to be re-used as long as attribution is given.
