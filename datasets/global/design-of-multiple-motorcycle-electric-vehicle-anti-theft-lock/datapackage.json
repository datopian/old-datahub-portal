The system proposed in this paper is available to sent the abnormal information about electric vehicle to owner’s mobile phone to realize the goal of remote prevention; if necessary, the owner can control electric vehicle by means of SMS to get the goal. In addition, the system is set with backup system in case of which the key of electric vehicle is out of hand, however, the availability of this case is limited to two times. The anti-theft system holds distinct features, simplicity in operation and high performance in anti-theft as well as low cost.\r\n",
