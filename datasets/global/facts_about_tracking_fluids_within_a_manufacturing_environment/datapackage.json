  "notes": "Amongst the labyrinth of most production facilities across the entire world is a succinctly built and incredibly intricate complex of varying machinery that function together to produce almost everything from throwaway knives and forks to the top selling hair conditioners. Hidden behind these carefully and attractively packaged customer goods is a whole system designed to ensure that these products are created to measure and standardized to ensure that the finish product is always identical. \n\nFor all those working in these manufacturing centers, monitoring the state of the equipment is at the heart of sustaining efficiency and by extension, profit. Irrespective of whether or not a business operates in the petro-chemical industries (exploration and refinery market sectors), power generation markets, or pharmaceutical drug production, fluid readings are essential to a job well done and any manufacturing workman will gladly laud the merits of an advanced, responsive and efficient complex of <a href=\"http://www.tc-fluidcontrol.com/products/instrument-valves/hand-operated-needle-valves\">needle valve</a>, gauges and <a href=\"http://www.tc-fluidcontrol.com/products/magnetic-level-gauges\">level transmitter</a> metres.\n\nAmongst the tools obtainable to manufacturers is a variety of indicators inbuilt into the manufacturing machinery",
