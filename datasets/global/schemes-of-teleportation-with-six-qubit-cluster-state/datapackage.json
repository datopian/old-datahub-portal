The first scheme is described as: the sender Alice introduced an auxiliary particle and operators orthogonal complete bases measurement, and the controller Bob performed non-Bell measurements on his particles in the quantum teleportation process. At last, the receiver Charlie can get the arbitrary two-qubit state only by operating appropriate unitary transformation. The second scheme is: the sender Alice operated joint Bell state measurement, and the controller Bob performed non-Bell measurements on his particles, the receiver introduced an auxiliary particle and operated appropriate unitary transformation, the quantum teleportation will be successful.",
