  "notes": "A New Lanthanum (III) coordination compound [La(PIP)2?2H2O](NO3)3 (PIP=2-phenyl-imazole[5,6-f]-1,10 phenanthroline) was synthesized. Its structure, optical gap, fluorescence properties and thermal properties were characterized by 1HNMR, elemental analysis, FT-IR spectra, UV-VIS spectra, fluorescence spectra, and DTA-TG technique. The results show that the complex has excellent thermal stability properties. The optical gap is 4.08eV. A Strong pure green emission at 543nm was found under the optimum excitation wavelength 437 nm. These results can be used in further studies of the structural and functional properties of electrolumescence devices based on the La-PIP assembly.  http://www.sjfcd.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=1036",
