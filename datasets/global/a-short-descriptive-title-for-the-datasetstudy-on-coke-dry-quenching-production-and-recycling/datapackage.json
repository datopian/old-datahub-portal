      "description": "Compared with wet quenching, coke dry quenching technology can increase the M40 and M10 of coke by 3-8% and 0.3-0.8% respectively, and decrease release of the pollutants, such as ammonia, phenol, cyanide and so on. After the application of coke dry quenching technology, the effluent from th e wastewater treatment sta tion of coking plant cannot be used for wet quenching as before, and is not allowed to be discharged either. In this paper, membrane technology was used as advanced treatment after the current secondary biological treatment. As a result, the effluent qua lity standard could be improved from the I -class criteria specified in “Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard” (GB 8978-1996) to criteria specified in “Design Specifications of Wastewater Reclamation and Reuse” (GB 50335-2002). According to the balance of quality and quantity of wastewater in coking plant, the effluent after advanced treatment was reused as circ ulating cooling water, which could save precious water resources and reduce emissions of pollutants.\r\n",
