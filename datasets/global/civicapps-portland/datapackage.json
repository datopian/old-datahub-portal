  "notes": "The purpose of the Catalog is to make public data easier to access, and in the process make government data more useful for everyone. The vision is that diverse and rich regional data will facilitate an unprecedented range of new information and options, enabling others to derive solutions to citizens needs.\r\n\r\nThe Catalog is unique because it includes public datasets from a wide array of local government jurisdictions. It is the only inter-jurisdictional repository of local public data of its kind in the United States, at least as far as we know. This would not be possible without data owners across the greater Portland area joining hands to make government an open data platform.\r\n\r\nAll datasets listed in this catalog appear to be open -- [data policy page][data-policy] states:\r\n\r\n[data-policy]: http://www.civicapps.org/about/data-policy\r\n\r\n> Data accessed through CivicApps.org do not include controls over its end use. However, as the Data Owner or authoritative source for the data, the submitting organization or Data Owner must retain version control of datasets accessed. Once the datasets have been downloaded, the Data Owner cannot vouch for their quality and timeliness. Furthermore, the Data Owner cannot vouch for any analyses conducted with data retrieved from CivicApps.org.",
