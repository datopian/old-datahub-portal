Implementation of the simulation teaching in public pedagogy can greatly stimulate students' interest in learning public pedagogy in normal university because of its unique forms and important values. Implementation of simulation teaching in public pedagogy generally takes two kinds of forms: primary and middle school teaching content simulation teaching, and higher education of normal education teaching content simulation teaching.
