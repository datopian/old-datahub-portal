The results show that technological progress is the main source of growth for TFP. The growth mode of construction industry is changing from an extensive one to an intensive one. By comparing efficiency indicators of the construction industry from different provinces, we found that the efficiency indicators of Shanghai, Beijing, and Zhejiang are in the leading level in our country, whose construction industries are with reasonable scale and advanced technology.",
