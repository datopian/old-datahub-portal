  "notes": "Disbursements of money under the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and its replacement/renaming as the Financial Stability Program (FSP). TARP was established under the EESA (The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which became law on October 3, 2008) during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. TARP was renamed to / replaced by the Financial Stability Program (FSP) on February 10 2009.\r\n### Comment on Sources\r\n#### Official\r\nOfficial Treasury info on TARP funds are under Investment Programs:\r\n<http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/investment-programs/>\r\nThere are 9 specific programs mentioned ranging from AIG to a 'Targeted Investment Program'. (Note that on Feb 10 2009 TARP was renamed to Financial Stability Program (FSP)). Finding the actual data takes a bit of work. Ultimately the best source I found was the 'Reports' section of the briefing room: <http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/briefing-room/reports/tarp-transactions/>. Unfortunately there is no single document but 100s (or possibly 1000s) of PDF and Excel files -- one is only presented with a single page of 20 items at a time with no indication of exactly how many pages there are (also there are occasionally just a PDF file e.g. for transactions on 09/23/2010).\r\n#### Other Sources\r\n**ProPublica**\r\nProPublica has excellent coverage, see <http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/main/about> and good data e.g. this list of recipients: <http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list/index.csv>. Unfortunately all their data is non-open:\r\n> All of the data in this section is available for download â€“ and you're free to reuse it so long as you give ProPublica credit, don't change any data, and don't sell it for money. (We're licensed under Creative Commons, which provides the legal details.) [As usual we are not told the CC license (as if they are all the same) but a check of the link indicates by-nc-nd which is kind of ironic given they claim it to be for reuse]\r\n**New York Times**\r\nNY Times has good coverage (and highly ranked!) but their source info is always pretty opaque. See e.g. [this total bailout cost graphic][graphic] which just states:\r\n> Sources: Treasury; Federal Reserve; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\r\nThere's more data in a table in [NYT this report][nyt-report] but again sources are opaque (\"Sources: Treasury; Bloomberg; Dow Jones; Stifel, Nicolaus & Company (Texas ratio); the companies\") and you'd need to scrape it.\r\n[graphic]: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/02/04/business/20090205-bailout-totals-graphic.html>\r\n[nyt-report]: http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/national/200904_CREDITCRISIS/recipients.html\r\n**Subsidyscope**\r\nGood data in web page: <http://subsidyscope.org/bailout/tarp/>. A big of digging reveals a csv link: <http://subsidyscope.org/bailout/tarp/csv/>. No license stated as far as I can see. Source info:\r\n> Data Sources: Information on the TARP transactions is from the Treasury Web site. Asset information, with a few exceptions, came from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; for institutions not found in the FDIC database, asset information from SNL Interactive, Google Finance or Securities and Exchange Commission filings (company 10Q reports) was used.\r\nProvides as a source <http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/eesa/tranche-reports.shtml>. However this link 404s with a page indicating that material has been reorganized. A search yields up [this page][new-tranche] which one can only assume is the same.\r\n[new-tranche]: http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/briefing-room/reports/tranche/Pages/default.aspx\r\n**Financial Stability**\r\nOther links point to <http://financialstability.org/> which was decommissioned and redirects into <http://treasury.gov/>\r\n",
