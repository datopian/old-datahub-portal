This system combined with the offline software is capable to realize these functions, such as charge integral, time measurement, waveform measurement and storage. The performance of the oscilloscope on data acquisition is studied in details with the comparison between the system and single photoelectron spectrum (SPE) of PMT R5912 measured by VME system.",
