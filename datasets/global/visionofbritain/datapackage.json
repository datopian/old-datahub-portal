  "notes": "### Description\r\n\r\n\"A vision of Britain between 1801 and 2001. Including maps, statistical trends and historical descriptions.\" More focused on re-organising the data for access by locality than on enabling downloading of the raw data but have clearly put significant time and energy into data extraction. Specifically they have:\r\n\r\n  * An [administrative gazetteer](http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/units/index.jsp) which includes:\r\n            * Youngs' *Local Administrative Units of England* (1979 and 1991)\r\n    * Melville Richards' *Welsh Administrative and Territorial Units* (1969)\r\n    * The Scottish Archives Network's Gazetteer, covering counties, parishes and burghs\r\n    * The National Register of Archives' *Manorial Documents Register*\r\n  * [Census reports from 1801-1961](http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/index.jsp) consisting of:\r\n    * Listings of all reports published from 1801 to 1961,\r\n        and all tables in those reports.\r\n        Unless you ask, we list only reports and tables for which\r\n        we hold data or text.\r\n    * The contents of selected tables, with headings and notes.\r\n    * Introductory text &#151; so far,\r\n        Abstracts 1801-41, Preliminary Reports 1851-1961,\r\n        and the 1911 General Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Openness: NOT OPEN\r\n\r\n  * License: someone, somewhere holds copyright and there's no explicit license.\r\n  * Access: all data is interwoven with text, graphics etc. Basically you'd need to do some really serious roboting/parsing to get any data out of this website, but most of the data can be obtained via the UK Data Archive at the University of Essex.\r\n    * bulk: no\r\n    * web-api: yes (OGC web map server access)\r\n    * website: yes (roboting: hard)\r\n\r\n#### License\r\n\r\nFrom the [license page](http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/footer/doc_text_for_title.jsp?topic=credits&seq=4):\r\n\r\n> Census data from 1961 to 2001 are © Office of National Statistics, for England and Wales, and © General Register Office, for Scotland.
