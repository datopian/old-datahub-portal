  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nThe UK's [Department for Transport (DfT)](http://www.dft.gov.uk/) has released data from the [National Public Transport Access Node (NaPTAN)](http://www.naptan.org.uk/) database to be put on [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](http://openstreetmap.org/).\r\n\r\nAs it says on the [NaPTAN website](http://www.naptan.org.uk/overview.htm):\r\n\r\n> NaPTAN provides a unique identifier for every point of access to public transport in the UK, together with meaningful text descriptions of the stop point and its location.\r\n\r\nThe [NaPTAN page on the OpenStreetMap wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NaPTAN) says the data contains:\r\n\r\n> [...] details of some 350,000 public transport access points in Great Britain including bus stops, railway stations, tram stops and ferry terminals. This data includes a name, geocode, official code and other information useful to the project. The data set includes both the physical points of access to transport (Platforms, bus stops, airport gateways, etc), the interchanges (Stations, Airports, Ports, Clusters, etc ) and the the entrances to the interchanges from the street or public thoroughfare [...]\r\n\r\nSee also the main [naptan package page](http://ckan.net/package/read/naptan).\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nWhile the main NaPTAN database has noncommercial restrictions (details on the [naptan package page](http://ckan.net/package/read/naptan)), under a special arrangement with the DfT and Traveline, the OpenStreetMap Foundation has been given access to the database to import useful and relevant data to OpenStreetMap under the terms of their license, which is the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license.\r\n\r\nAn [email from Roger Slevin at the DfT earlier this year](http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-transit/2009-March/000163.html) placates the concerns that Ordnance Survey may claim rights in the data:\r\n\r\n> I am conscious that some concern has been expressed about whether OS has any rights to the NaPTAN data (or NPTG) - and I can assure the OSM community that the Department for Transport has been assured by Ordnance Survey that they do not claim any rights over NaPTAN location data - and it is a matter of record that Department for Transport is the owner of the NPTG database. Both NaPTAN and NPTG are maintained by DfT as national databases, collating data from all local transport authorities in England, Wales and Scotland.\r\n\r\nFurther details of the import agreement are available at:\r\n\r\n  * <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NaPTAN/Import>\r\n\r\nSee also the main [osm](http://ckan.net/package/read/osm) package.",
