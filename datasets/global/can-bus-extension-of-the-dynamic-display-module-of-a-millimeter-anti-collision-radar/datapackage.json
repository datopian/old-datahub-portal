This article describes an embedded system approach based on ARM11 (with S3C6410 as the main control chip) as the core of hardware platforms, with Linux operating system as the software platform for the auto anti-collision radar dynamic display module. We expand the MCP2515 CAN bus-based architecture on the traditional SPI subsystem, and realize the data communications of auto electronic system in the embedded systems. We also present the specific hardware circuit design and implementation of our embedded system platform based on Linux.",
