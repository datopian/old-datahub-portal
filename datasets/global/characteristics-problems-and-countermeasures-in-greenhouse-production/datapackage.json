Because of the difference between greenhouse environment and open field planting, some problems such as soil acidification and salinization, increased disease and pest calamity, environmental pollution, and farm produce security will crop up with the continuous planting years. To solve those problems, scientific fertilization, reasonable irrigation, and comprehensive agriculture measures should be taken into consideration. In the future, greenhouse in China will focus on regionalization, energy saving, and specialization, so as to provide the society with more abundant green health food with high quality and security.",
