      "description": " The consistency of the infrared spectrograms of thirty samples of each kind of Chinese Patent Medicines for Children was investigated by cluster analysis. The results show that the infrared spectrograms of thirty samples of Xiao’er Biyan Pian, Xiao’er Qingfeizhike Pian and Xiao’er Qingganling Pian were in good agreement, respectively. The infrared fingerprints of three kinds of Chinese Patent Medicines were established by average method. The infrared fingerprints of three kinds of Chinese Patent Medicines were compared using the similarity degrees of the characteristic curves. The results indicate that the significant difference was observed between two kinds of Chinese Patent Medicines and the infrared fingerprints can be used to the quality identification of Chinese Patent Medicines.",
