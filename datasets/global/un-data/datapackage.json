  "notes": "The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) launched a new internet based data service for the global user community [as of 2009!]. It brings UN statistical databases within easy reach of users through a single entry point (http://data.un.org/). Users can now search and download a variety of statistical resources of the UN system.\r\n\r\nRelation to UNCDB (dataset:uncdb):\r\n\r\nUNdata is replacing the UNCDB. The new system goes beyond the concept of the UNCDB, starting from the way the data is stored and searched to the data presentation. Furthermore, the UNCDB only includes a small selection of UNSD's extensive data collection, whereas UNdata will have broader data coverage from various international and national sources.\r\n\r\nThe UNCDB series are currently available through UNdata under the new name \"Key indicators\". Please note that the Key indicator's scope has already been reduced, as some of the series have been included from the original data provider.\r\n\r\nThe UNCDB will be discontinued this summer [2009] after the academic year finished in most schools around the globe.\r\n\r\n### Access\r\n\r\n[FAQ](http://data.un.org/wiki/faq.ashx) says:\r\n\r\n> [..] unfortunately, 50,000 is the maximum number of records that are downloadable at any one time.\r\n\r\nAn unofficial API is provided at [www.undata-api.org](http://www.undata-api.org/)  \r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[Terms of use](http://data.un.org/wiki/disclaimer.ashx) state:\r\n\r\n> All data and metadata provided on UNdataâ€™s website are available free of charge and may be copied freely, duplicated and further distributed provided that they are not put up for sale or otherwise commercially exploited and that UNdata is cited as the reference.",
