The design of matched filter for underwater target image identification considers not only the situation of translation, rotation and scaling distortion, but also the image quality of the underwater range-gated imaging system, of which image distortion lead to falldown of PV, PCE, SNR value measuring the output-related peak. The paper analyzed the relationship of underwater range-gated laser imaging system ICCD gain and the recognition effect, and promoted a synthetic discriminant function (SDF) to produce an anti-distortion matched filter to improve the distortion tolerance of the matched filter.
