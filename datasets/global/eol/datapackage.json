Our goal is to create a constantly evolving encyclopedia that lives on the Internet, with contributions from scientists and amateurs alike. To transform the science of biology, and inspire a new generation of scientists, by aggregating all known data about every living species. And ultimately, to increase our collective understanding of life on Earth, and safeguard the richest possible spectrum of biodiversity.\r\n\r\n### Openness: Mixed\r\n\r\n#### License\r\n\r\nDoes not have a single license but allow for use of any of main CC licenses (some of which are incompatible!).
