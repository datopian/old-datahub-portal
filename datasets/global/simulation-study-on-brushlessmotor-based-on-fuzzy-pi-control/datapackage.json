      "description": "Brushless DC motor ( BLDCM ) is a variable, strong coupling, nonlinear system, the simulation model is hard to be established. To solve this problem, based on the principle and structure of the brushless DC motor (BLDCM), and analyzing the mathematic mode, a simulation model of BLDCM control system is established in Matlab/Simulink by the modular design, and the fuzzy PI control algorithm of prototype is designed. The simulation results show that the fuzzy-PI control speeds up response time, reduces the overshoot, and has strong robust, so it can make the system has better control performance and good applying value.",
