  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nFrom the website:\r\n\r\n> The Culture Grid is designed to do two things. Firstly, it pulls together information from the thousands of museum, archive and library websites and databases. Secondly, it serves this information up to media partners such as Google and the BBC to ensure that it is available to as wide an audience as possible.\r\n\r\nCulture Grid aggregates content from a growing variety of cultural institutions. Current contributors are listed on the detailed search page :\r\nhttp://culturegrid.org.uk/discover/advanced. Some specific sub-collections available via culture-grid are:\r\n\r\nBeamish Treasures,  Bede's World,  Bowes Museum,  Collect Britain,  Collections Base,  Commanet,  Cornucopia,  Cornucopia, DiadEM,  Cornucopia Egyptology,  Cornucopia Familia,  Cornucopia Inspire,  Cornucopia London Libraries,\r\n  Cornucopia Portraiture,\r\n  Devon Etched,\r\n  Dorset Coast Digital Archive,\r\n  Durham County Council,\r\n  English Heritage,\r\n  Exploring 20th Century London,\r\n  Bishopsgate Institute,\r\n  Brent Museum,\r\n  Bromley Museum,\r\n  Croydon Museum and Heritage Service,\r\n  Florence Nightingale Museum,\r\n  Geffrye Museum,\r\n  Burgh House and Hampstead Museum,\r\n  Bruce Castle Museum (Haringey),\r\n  Horniman Museum,\r\n  Jewish Museum,\r\n  London Transport Museum,\r\n  Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture,\r\n  Museum of London,\r\n  Redbridge Local Studies,\r\n  Redbridge Museum,\r\n  World Rugby Museum,\r\n  Fitzwilliam Museum,\r\n  Folk Archive Resource North East,\r\n  Geffrye Museum Test,\r\n  Hunterian Museum,\r\n  iSee Gateshead,\r\n  Kirklees Image Archive,\r\n  Lambeth Landmark,\r\n  Leodis,\r\n  Manchester City Galleries,\r\n  Michael UK,\r\n  Michael UK DCollections,\r\n  Michael UK Institutions,\r\n  Michael UK PCollections,\r\n  Michael UK Projects,\r\n  Michael UK Service,\r\n  MLA Institutions,\r\n  Picture the Past,\r\n  Portable Antiquities,\r\n  Sense of Place South East,\r\n  Seven Stories,\r\n  Tyne and Wear Imagine\r\n\r\n### Access\r\n\r\nThe Culture Grid content is best thought of, like most repositories, as a constantly expanding stream of content rather than something that is versioned in discrete chunks. Access is via the OAIPMH protocol which can be used to download the full set of culture grid records, and to obtain change-sets of records updated since the last OAI harvest.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nNot clear. Website states: \r\n\r\n> Copyright Â© Collections Trust 2009. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nContent is aggregated and preserved from a number of host organisations and services and made public by the grid. Culture-Grid itself acts as a referetory and is trying to clarify licensing with each data provider. Generally, the metadata is freely available although the content the metadata points back to will be licensed differently. Each individual metadata record has a license property. By default CG Content is licensed CC-nc-nd license, but users should check on a per record basis. It is possible to filter searches by license (dcterms.license). For OAI, developers would need to check license by license. Use of OAI to gather updates would alert harvesters to re-licensed records.\r\n\r\nThe Copyright statement on the site most likely refers to the site content rather than the culture grid content.",
