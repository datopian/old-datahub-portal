      "description": "This paper makes a comparison of the capabilities of the high-resolution regional climate model RegCM3 with that of PRECIS (Providing Regional climates for Impact Studies). RegCM3, developed by the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, and PRECIS, developed by Hadley centre of climate prediction and research, were both widely applied to climate simulation, while the inter-comparison analysis of long-term climate simulations over Xinjiang by the two models had not been carried out. In this paper, the capabilities of these two models are accessed through comparative analysis of simulating temperature as well as precipitation and observed value. The result shows that PRECIS performed better in simulating temperature and precipitation climatology over Xinjiang than RegCM3, and the simulation results generally matched well with the observation. Then analytical investigation is undertaken by simulating temperature and precipitation climatology over Xinjiang during 2071-2100a with PRECIS under the IPCC SERS A2 scenario.",
