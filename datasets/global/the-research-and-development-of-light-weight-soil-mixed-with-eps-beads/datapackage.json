      "description": "This study aims to summarize the research and development of light-weight soil mixed within EPS beads at home and abroad. It is point out that the confining pressure, cement content, EPS be ads content, water content and curing time have a profound effect on the mechanical properties, the strength and deformation properties. And from the macroscopic and microscopic, the formation of the shear strength and the failure mechanism are revealed. T he literature also presents the experimental studies of creep, permeability and water absorbability in order to confront practical applications, especially under dynamic loads. It is found that the confining pressure, cement content, EPS beads content are main factors to the relationship between the dynamic stress and strain, the dynamic strength ,dynamic modulus and damping ratio. At last, the article introduces some engineering applications, then points out the existing problems about researching EPS comp osite soil which should be paid more attention.\r\n\r\n",
