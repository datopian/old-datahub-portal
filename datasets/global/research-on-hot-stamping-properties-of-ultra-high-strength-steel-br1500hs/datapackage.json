      "description": "Hot stamping properties of BR1500HS would be studied by two different heat treatment tests of the steel, such as die quenching and water quenching treatment. It is found that heating temperature and holding time had a significant influence up on mechanical properties, and the optimum parameters have been defined as heating temperature at 950℃, holding time for 4 min and the minimum flow velocity of 0.75m/s, based on the microstructure and mechanical properties analyzed at different heat treatment conditions in the test of die quenching. While in the test of water quenching in which the influence of heating temperature (equal to quenching temperature now) and holding time on mechanical properties of boron steel was studied, it is also found that holding time has little effect on mechanical properties when heating temperature lowered certain value (such as 840℃) in which case, Boron Steel with high mechanical properties can obtained by prolonging the holding time. It can be found from the comparison between the two tests that Boron Steel treated with water quenching outperforms the other one on the tensile strength but the material is relative fragile, and that die quenching is the better way to obtain higher yield rate and hot stamping parts with comprehensive performances in the course of hot stamping production.\r\n",
