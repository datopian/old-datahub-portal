      "description": "The stability of urban water supply pipelines seriously impacts the quality of water supplies for production and daily life, thus the switched adaptive water supply with PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) as main controller is designed. The main principles it applies are constant-pressure principle and Vvvf principle which are used in traditional waterworks and the up-to-date switched adaptive control principle. The mathematical model has been established with practical applications and various interfering factors. Studies mainly based on switched adaptive control principle make the system adjusted by itself and then achieve a better water supply. The simulation to the system by MATLAB confirms its rationality, superiority and feasibility.",
