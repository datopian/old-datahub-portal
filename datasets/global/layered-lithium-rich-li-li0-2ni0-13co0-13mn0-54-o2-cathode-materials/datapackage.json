      "description": "In this work, the layered lithium-rich Li[Li0.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54]O2 materials were synthesized by sol-gel, co-precipitation and ball-milling methods followed by calcinations at a high temperature. The crystal structure was analysized through X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of products were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The results suggest that the products synthesized by sol-gel and co-precipitation methods have perfect layered crystal structure and display uniform particle size. Their initial discharge capacities are as high as 259 and 255 mAh?g-1 at 0.1C, respectively. However, the product prepared by ball-milling method exhibits lager particle size and unsatisfied electrochemical properties such as its initial discharge capacity of 153 mAh?g-1 at 0.1C.",
