Methods The ability of tetrandrine to inhibit cells was detected by the MTT method. Results The IC50 of tetrandrine to A549 were 8.57 ?g/mL, 6.25 ?g/mL, 4.43 ?g/mL,for 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, respectively. Conclusion Different concentrations of tetrandrine on lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells inhibit the proliferation and showed significant time and dose-effect relationship. Tetrandrine in vitro can inhibit the growth of A549 lung cancer cells.",
