      "description": "Based on the JX-300X DCS control platform, the multiple water tanks CS4000 experimental device’s fuzzy control system is developed. According to development requirements, JX-300X configuration and fuzzy controller design are made. The configuration of JX-300X DCS includes system overall configuration, control station configuration, operator station configuration. Fuzzy controller is firstly designed in Matlab 7.1 environment and then applied to JX-300X DCS. At the same time, control system with different parameters is debugged. The experimental results show that, the designed fuzzy controller has smaller overshoot, shorter response time and superior performances than conventional PID controller.",
