  "notes": "Manage your images only from the image management software. Once you move image files at the desktop level of your computer, you?re going to be in a world of hurt. Use your image management program to move, copy and delete your images, or risk the software loosing track of where your images are. Also, consider centralizing where your images are physically stored on your computer system. Backing up from one location is a time saver, and keeping everything on an external hard drive is handy if you need to grab and go. My computer is where I obviously work on all the photos, but I only keep the more recent sets on there.? More will be explained why later.? When I started to shoot Windows 2000 was my operating system, I?ve since moved to Mac but the structure in which I store my photos hasn?t changed.? I know Lightroom, Aperture and iPhoto will all store and catalog my photos, I have never found them to be that good at it though. My photography tends to be done in batches, over a long period of time, and a long way from the office. Sort of like those vacations we discussed last week, only I'm working ",
