      "description": "Abstract: Each seed of the wheat plants infected by common bunts is completely filled with black spores containing poisonous trimethylamine and giving off a fishy odor. A single infected seed, usually called “bunt ball”, contains at least 10 millions of teliospores that can be easily dispersed in many ways to possibly infect the next generation of wheat plants, or contaminate commercial wheat grains, food and/or feed. Infections of wheat bunts have been reported in at least 16 provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin since 1995, and which seems going to to be worse. In this study 4 samples of wheat bunts from southern Shanxi were identified using microscope and SEM. It is confirmed that they are all Tilletia foetida (Wallr.) Lindr..The average diameter of the tested teliospores is ~15 µm; the surface of the teliospores is smooth. The 4 layers of the pericarp of the bunt balls are the same as that of the healthy seed. Using mustard flour or Muscodor albus agents to control wheat bunts are worth trying in China. Using the bunt balls to produce trimethylamine, is also an alternative suggestion.",
