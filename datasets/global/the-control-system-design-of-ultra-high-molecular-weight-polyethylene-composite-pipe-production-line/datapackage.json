The designed system in the paper improves the accuracy of control in the production line and stabilizes the runs, which is realized by the applications of B&R power panel as the controller and the transducer based on two different types (SJ200, SJ300), as well the establishment of the RS485 two-circuit communication network. We’ll elaborate the control system both on hardware and software in this paper.",
