  "notes": "In 2007, driver distractions, such as using a cell phone or text messaging, contributed to nearly 1,000 crashes involving 16- and 17-year-old drivers. Many localities have enacted their own bans on cellphones or text messaging. In some but not all states, local jurisdictions need specific statutory authority to do so. Maybe you?d be interested in a car powered by natural gas. It?s cheaper than gasoline and the cars are now becoming available in our area.\n\nStates have to put policies in place with incentives that encourage consumers to switch, he said. Those incentives could involve making CNG fueling stations available, subsidizing vehicles or in-home fueling stations, or by lowering retail prices for natural gas. Surveys indicate that NGVs are as safe or safer than those powered by other fuels. A 1992 AGA survey of more than 8,000 vehicles found that with more than 278 million miles traveled, NGV injury rates per vehicle mile traveled were 34 percent lower than the rate for gasoline vehicles. There were no fatalities reported--even though these vehicles were involved in more than 1,800 collisions. Tailpipe emissions from gasoline operated cars release carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. This is greatly reduced with natural gas. The advantages of natural gas are fairly well known.  It's abundant, cheap, clean, and is provided domestically.\n\nIt has been a great Monday day! I hope you enjoyed you day!
