      "description": "Madden NFL 07 Cheats - GamecubeCheats for Madden NFL 07 on Gamecube.From Jason Rybka, former About.com GuideCheats, Codes, and SecretsThe following cheats, codes, and secrets are available for Madden NFL 07 on the Nintendo Gamecube video game console.QB On Target cardEnter WROA0R as a code. Your Quarterback will have 100% accuracy for one half.Mistake Free cardEnter XL7SP1 as a code. It will be impossible to throw an interception or fumble the ball for one half.Lame Duck cardEnter 5LAWO0 as a code. Your opponent will be forced to throw lob passes for one half.Hint: Easy Madden TokensThe following is an easy way to earn Madden Tokens to get Madden Cards fast. Play a Two Minute Drill after going to the rosters to change some player stats. It does not matter which team you change the stats to, just make them very good. for example, if you go to the Saints, make the entire offensive line very good. Then, do the same for the fullback and halfback. Then go a team you plan to go against in the Two Minute Drill. Go to their defense and make their speed and awareness very low for all the defensive players. Once done, go to Two Minute Drill. Select how many players you want, set the difficulty to All-Maddenn make sure your profile shows up to the left side of the teams you selected. If you plan to run against the defense, try a HB toss to run on the outside. If you pass, throw Hail Marys the entire time. Your receiver that was made very good should burn the defensive backs, more so if you make them very tall and skinny. They can make jump catches all the time. for some reason, running the ball for touchdowns gives you more points, so mix it up.Hint: Recommended defenseTry blitzing on first and second downs but not on the third down. Your opponent may be used to rushing his throws and throw the ball right into your coverage.Hint: Performance Institute revisitYou can use the Performance Institute more than once in one week during the Superstar and Hall of Fame modes. to use the Performance Institute more than once in one week (assuming if your agent lets you use it), first go to your schedule and simulate up to the day that you have your game. Then go to the Performance Institute and do your normal <a href=http://farrdesign.com/jerseys/?id=103>ebay nfl jerseys</a> drill. Go to your schedule and start your game. However when you get to the kickoff, quit and go back to the Performance Institute. You should be able to attend once more (before the game).Hint: Get any playerUse the following trick to obtain almost any player desired in Franchise mode. Go to the desired player in the \"View Roster\" menu. Make sure there are more than enough players in the position he is in. Go to \"Edit Player\" then \"Information\". Change his position to something that would make him overall bad. for example, make Ladanian Tomlinson a linebacker. Go to \"Trade Player\" and trade someone with a higher rating than him for that player. Once you get the <a href=http://tacosandtequilalv.com/nfljerseys/?id=734>buy cheap nfl jerseys online</a> player on your team, change them back to their original position.Hint: Fantasy draftDo not draft a running back because Reggie Bush will not be selected until the ninth round. You can choose him late and he is amazing. If you do the highlight stick he is unbeatable. Also for your first draft pick, it must be a quarterback. Make sure he is ranked at least 94 overall. Even a perfectly created quarterback will not get you Brady Palmer or Manning.Hint: Avoiding injuriesWhen you think one of your players may be injured on offense, hurry the play up and they will get back up.More Hints and Tips",
