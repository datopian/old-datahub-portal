  "notes": "In this paper, the pre-aeration, activated carbon and anthracite filler vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland simulation system was described. The main changes under different pre-aeration time and hydraulic loading were discussed in the vertical flow wetland system about NH3-N removal effect. When ammonia nitrogen concentration changed under hydraulic loading of 0.064 m3 / (m2•d) and preaeration time of 10 minutes, the removal effect of ammonia was the best.\r\nhttp://www.ivypub.org/fes/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2602",
