CGO was incorporated as a public benefit corporation in late 2006, and is currently applying for its own 501(c)3 status.\r\n\r\n> Can you briefly describe the website?\r\n\r\n> The website is a tool for open-content participatory journalism. It allows people to investigate important issues by providing a space where people can collaborate on the documentation of past and current events, as well as the entities associated with those events. The website can be used to investigate topics at the local, regional, or global level. The data is displayed on the website in the form of dynamic timelines and entity profiles, and is exportable into XML so it can be shared with others for non-commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n> What kind of information is available on this website?\r\n\r\n> * Information about specific events. There are currently 12,920 events profiled in our database. Visitors can view these events by searching the database, or by browsing through timelines.\r\n> * Information about specific entities. More than 5,000 entities are currently in the database. They include individuals, organizations, businesses, etc. For each entity there is an entity profile page which includes (1) information about the entity; (2) links to related entities; and (3) a chronology of all events in which the entity was an active participant. Visitors can view entity profiles by searching the database, or by clicking on one of the entity links at the bottom of an event.\r\n\r\n### Access/re-use\r\n\r\nCan't find bulk download facility.
