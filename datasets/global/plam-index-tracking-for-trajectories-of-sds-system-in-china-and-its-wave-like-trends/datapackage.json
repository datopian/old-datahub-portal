      "description": "The characteristic distributions of regional sand and dust storm (SDS) from 1980 to 2011 were investigated using meteorological elements data from surface stations, atmospheric sounding data, high density weather data of CMA (Chinese Meteorological Administration), as well as the archived Chinese original weather maps. Based on the SDS deposited PSCF（Potential source contribution function）method, a tracking analysis of sand-dust weather process was developed by using the index calculating of the PLAM (Parameters of Air quality and Meteorology) in range of North-East Asia region. A spline trend analysis method was also used to investigate the strength variability of the SDS systems. The results show that during the period of 1980 to 2011, the SDS processes have a wave change status, featuring both a historical persistence and abrupt transition with about a 10 year high-low oscillation.",
