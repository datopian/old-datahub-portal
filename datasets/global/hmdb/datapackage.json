  "notes": "## About\r\n\r\n> The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. It is intended to be used for applications in metabolomics, clinical chemistry, biomarker discovery and general education. The database is designed to contain or link three kinds of data: 1) chemical data, 2) clinical data, and 3) molecular biology/biochemistry data. The database currently contains nearly 2500 metabolite entries including both water-soluble and lipid soluble metabolites as well as metabolites that would be regarded as either abundant (> 1 uM) or relatively rare (< 1 nM). Additionally, approximately 5500 protein (and DNA) sequences are linked to these metabolite entries. Each MetaboCard entry contains more than 90 data fields with half of the information being devoted to chemical/clinical data and the other half devoted to enzymatic or biochemical data. Many data fields are hyperlinked to other databases (KEGG, PubChem, MetaCyc, ChEBI, PDB, Swiss-Prot, and GenBank) and a variety of structure and pathway viewing applets. The HMDB database supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure and relational query searches. Two additional databases, DrugBank and FooDB are also part of the HMDB. DrugBank contains equivalent information on 1500 drugs while FooDB contains equivalent information on 3500 food components and food additives.\r\n\r\n## Openness\r\n\r\nFreely available, but requires permission for commercial re-use or re-distribution:\r\n\r\n> HMDB is offered to the public as a freely available resource. Use and re-distribution of the data, in whole or in part, for commercial purposes requires explicit permission of the authors and explicit acknowledgment of the source material (HMDB) and the original publication (see below). We ask that users who download significant portions of the database cite the HMDB paper in any resulting publications.",
