  "notes": "OTALEX is financed by the European programme INTERREGIII A, and its objective is to study and show the reality of a territory, which is composed of the Alentejo region in Portugal and the Extremadura region in Spain, conventionally separated by an administrative frontier but joined by their physical, environmental, social and economic features. It is about rural spaces of low demographic density where natural and cultural resources together with environmental quality represent its basic attraction.\r\nThe IDE OTALEX is the result of the effort, commitment and collaboration between institutions from both frontier sides, with the three administrative levels involvement: State, Regional and Local. It shows how to make the Alentejo-Extremadura territory data homogeneus and standard, using maps visualization clients, place names and catalogue searches, always following the INSPIRE directives.",
