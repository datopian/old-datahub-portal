      "description": "With the development of social economy, cases of security happen frequently, thus security is becoming more and more important. Because of the shortcoming of blindness, passiveness, randomness, etc., the traditional method of routing inspection is advised to be replaced by the Security Inspection System designed in this paper. The new system combines the RFID and the Information Technology. After setting tag information, setting route, appointing task in computer terminal, inspectors inspects with the help of inspection device according to the pre-set route and task. When inspection finishes, the records will be uploaded to computer for statistic analysis and relative chart drawing. This system could make the management of security more scientific, and make the inspection more ordered and more efficient. Through quantization and dynamic management of routing inspection, security of the environment where people live and work will be better ensured.",
