This paper comparatively analyzed the critical gap and headway on the condition of ice-and-snow or normal, and then analyzed the capacity of non-signaled intersection by the acceptability gap theory, and put forward the headway modify coefficient and the non-signaled intersection capacity modify coefficient for ice and snow. The results are the complementarities of traffic flow characteristic on ice-and-snow condition, and they are useful for directing setting traffic engineering facilities in the cold zone.\r\n",
