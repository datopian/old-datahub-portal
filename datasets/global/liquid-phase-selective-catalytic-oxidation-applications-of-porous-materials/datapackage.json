  "notes": " Porous materials are of great significance in selective catalytic oxidation Porous materials are of great significance in selective catalytic oxidation processes due to the fact that the materials are environmental-friendly and only few by-products could be generated during the process. A series of porous materials have been used in selective oxidation of bulky molecules to different organic compounds such as 2-methoxy-5-methyl-1, 4-benzoquinone, p-bromobenzaldehyde, 2-acetoxycyclohexanol, benzophenone, cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol and so on. High substrate conversion and product selectivity could be achieved under mild conditions. Besides, the biological templates were employed as macroscale sacrificial structure builder to synthesize porous oxides with particular morphologies which were used as efficient catalysts for the liquid-phase oxidation reactions.  http://www.sjfcd.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=1033",
