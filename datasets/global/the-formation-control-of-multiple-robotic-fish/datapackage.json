The algorithm adopts the formation parameter matrix to establish the relative relationship among robotic fishes and uses the idea of transit points selected according to the characteristics of the robotic fish to transform the global-level formation control problem into the problem of transit point of the follower tracking the transit point of the leader. Based on the derived error tracking system model, the control law is used in design to maintain the formation. And the law also considers real-time local position feedback of the robotic fish. Simulation and experiment results are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.",
