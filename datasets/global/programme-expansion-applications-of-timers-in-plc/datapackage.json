  "notes": "This paper explores the way to improve PLC timer precision, to get PLCâ€™s delayed on of normally open contact, delayed off of normally closed contact, delayed off normally open contact, delayed on of normally closed contact, to realize on/off delay control[1], expand and change the set value of timer, and to realize the square-wave generator method. After analyzing, designing, and summarizing, a number of small modules, which could be an on-demand integration to form a project management in practice, are formed. The ladder diagrams and waveforms have been verified in Panasonic FP1-C72PLC control unit, and are also verified in practice and application.  http://www.sj-ce.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=193",
