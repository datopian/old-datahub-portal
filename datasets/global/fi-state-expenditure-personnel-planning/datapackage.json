  "notes": "Netra - the Finnish State Internet Reporting\r\n\r\nNetra is a reporting service provided by the State Treasury to openly report the performance and personnel information and expenditures of the Finnish state. In the first phase you have access to monthly information in the state central bookkeeping system, as well as to a collection of official documents concerning economic and operational planning and follow-up. You are also offered some other key information about the Finnish state, e.g. its budget.\r\n\r\nNetra is a Finnish service to the Finnish citizens, state administration and media. Since almost none of the reporting information included is available in English, we will not provide an English interface either. Alas, but you are always welcome to use the Finnish service.",
