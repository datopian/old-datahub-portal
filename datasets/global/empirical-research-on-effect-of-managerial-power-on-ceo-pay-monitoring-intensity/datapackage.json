  "notes": "The paper focuses on the special manipulation effect of managerial power on CEO pay considering the moderating role of monitoring intensity in China. The paper empirically indicates that the manipulation effect of managerial power on CEO pay does exist, and quantitatively describes the degree of the manipulation effect, which shows that the manipulation effect of managerial power on CEO pay significantly decreases. The results prove that monitoring intensity can restrain the manipulation effect of managerial power on CEO pay. Only under a certain monitoring intensity, will CEO pay not exceed the reasonable level too heavily.\r\nhttp://www.ivypub.org/msr/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2354",
