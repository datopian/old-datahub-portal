  "notes": "Cu2ZnSnS4 solid solutions were synthesized via a coprecipitation method using Zn(NO3)2?6H2O, SnCl4?H2O, CuCl2?2H2O and Na2S?9H2O as the raw materials at ambiant temperature. The effects of calcination temperature, initial pH value, Zn/Sn amount-of-substance ratio and illumination time on photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) were investigated. The physicochemical properties of the sample have been characterized by XRD, SEM, UV-Vis DRS and other techniques. The results indicate that the highest degradation rate of 20 ppm RhB can be over 96% with Zn/Sn amount-of-substance ratio of 1, the calcined temperature of 100â„ƒ and the initial pH value of 7.0 under visible light irradiation for 150 min.  http://www.sjfcd.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=1200",
