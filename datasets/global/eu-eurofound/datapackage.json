  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\n> Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, is a European Union body, one of the first to be established to work in specialised areas of EU policy. Specifically, it was set up by the European Council (Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1365/75 of 26 May 1975), to contribute to the planning and design of better living and working conditions in Europe.\r\n\r\n### Downloading\r\n\r\nData is available from the Quality of Life Surveys from 2005 and 2007:\r\n\r\n * <http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/results.htm>\r\n * <http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/surveys/ewcs2005/results.htm>\r\n\r\nAnswers to the questions in the survey are available in CSV format sorted by country and broken down by gender, age, and income\r\n\r\nFor example, see levels of happiness by:\r\n\r\n * Gender: <http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/includes/smt/x2f2.php?t=/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/2eqls_03_13.html&g=gender&id=EF-SMT-DataTable-1&f=csv>\r\n * Age: <http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/includes/smt/x2f2.php?t=/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/2eqls_03_13.html&g=age&id=EF-SMT-DataTable-3&f=csv>\r\n * Income: <http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/includes/smt/x2f2.php?t=/areas/qualityoflife/eqls/eqls2007/2eqls_03_13.html&g=income&id=EF-SMT-DataTable-5&f=csv>\r\n\r\n[FAQ](http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/faq/index.htm) says that Eurofound has an agreement with UK Data Archive (UKDA) regarding preservation of datasets:\r\n\r\n> Eurofound has signed an agreement with the UK Data Archive (UKDA) for preservation and third party access of its European survey datasets (surveys). Copies of the datasets and accompanying material are stored with the UKDA in Essex, UK and promoted online via its centre for secondary use of quantitative and qualitative data in research, teaching and learning, the Economic and Social Data Service-international (ESDS).\r\n\r\n> It is Eurofound’s policy to make the datasets and accompanying documentation available for third party use following its own publication of the main analytical report(s). This would normally be one year, maximum two years following the completion of the survey fieldwork. \r\n\r\nHence material is available via ESDS at:\r\n\r\n * <http://www.esds.ac.uk/international/access/I33365.asp>\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nAppears as though data is not open as permission is required for commercial re-use. [FAQ](http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/faq/index.htm) states that:\r\n\r\n> Access is freely available to all registered users for not-for-profit purposes. When clicking on the button ‘Downloading/order’, one has to:\r\n\r\n>> * log-in on the basis of a username and password. Once an organisation is registered, anyone working for this organisation can login.\r\n>> * fill out an ‘End-user license’.\r\n\r\n> Eurofound will receive two reports a year detailing the usage of the surveys. Only requests for usage for commercial purposes will be forwarded to Eurofound for authorisation. This allows Eurofound to consider each of these requests on their own merits and to set any specific conditions for its usage.",
