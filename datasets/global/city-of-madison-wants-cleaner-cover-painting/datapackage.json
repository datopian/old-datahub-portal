Director George Hank said the city ordinance is not content-based paint, but because the koopower.com is not allowed to paint signs directly in the building.\r\nBut the club's co-owner Dean McConley feel most distinguished. He said that other companies have the ability to have a mural painted on their walls.\r\nMcConley not say whether he had painted on the sign.",
