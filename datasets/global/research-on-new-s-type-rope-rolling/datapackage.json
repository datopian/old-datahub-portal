  "notes": " It mainly depends on the preloaded force of the spring to press the steel wire rope in the traditional hoist mechanism, achieving the movement of the working platform. But this method results some problems, such as it is difficult to control for preloaded force of the spring, the pressing force of plate distributes unevenly and others, leading the life of steel wire rope is too short. To solve those problems , we analysis wire rope tension of the hoist winding mechanism and the pressure of pressure plate, basing on the theory of friction drive. Accordingly, the lifting force is contact to the pressure of plate pressure. Based on this, a new type of hoist rope rolling pressing mechanism with the pre-deformation in the pressure plate is designed and the contour curve equation of pressure plate is derived. At the same time, the rope rolling pressing mechanism structure is simplified, reali zing the uniform pressing force distribution and enhancing the service life of the rope.\r\nhttp://www.ivypub.org/med/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2385",
