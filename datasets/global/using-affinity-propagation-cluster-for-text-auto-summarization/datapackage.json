  "notes": "Automatic summarization can help us accurately and efficiently obtain the information needed from the magnanimity information and has attracted more attention. In this paper, a new method for Chinese text summarization using the algorithm of Affinity Propagation Cluster (APC) is presented. It is not necessary to set the number of clusters and the initial representative exemplars in APC, so it can avoid the problems of local-optimal and instable clustering results caused by randomly selecting initial representative exemplars. And the algorithm has high computing efficiency. The results of the experiments show us that Chinese text automatic summarization based on APC has higher accuracy than KNN cluster. APC is a suitable method for automatic text summarization.  http://www.sjie.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=244",
