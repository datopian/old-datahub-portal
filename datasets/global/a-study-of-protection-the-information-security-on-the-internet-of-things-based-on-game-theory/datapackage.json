  "notes": " Firstly, this paper introduces the technology for the Internet of Things and the characteristics of information security, and discusses the needs of security related the internet of things. This method based on combination of the dependency strategy between the attacker and defender is proposed for protection the internet information security. Secondly , a set of effective security system model which ensure the interests of defenders based on game theory is proposed. The research results demonstrate that the system gives the best response decision strategy, and the strategy for in the face of attack. It is conducive to the analysis of practical problems and provides a new reference for the integrity of the information security system of the Internet of Things.\r\nhttp://www.ivypub.org/cst/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2384",
