  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\n> The Council's rules of procedure as amended following the Seville European Council state that the Council's deliberations on acts to be adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure shall be open to the public. Council sessions are also public when the Commission presents its most important legislative proposals and during the ensuing debate in the Council.\r\n\r\n> In addition, it is laid down that the vote on legislative acts adopted by codecision shall be open to the public.  In such cases, Council deliberations are made public through transmission of the Council meeting by audiovisual means, notably in an overflow room. The outcome of voting is indicated by visual means in real time in the Council's meeting room and on a television screen which relays the voting to the Press Centre.\r\n\r\n### Downloading\r\n\r\nNo bulk download. Details of votes from 2006 to present are available in PDF format.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nConsulium [copyright page](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.aspx?name=copyright&lang=EN&id=1) says:\r\n\r\n> Â© Council of the European Union.
