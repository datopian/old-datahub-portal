It is pointed out that there are many amino and imino groups on the chain of poly(phenylenediamine) with a ladder and semi-ladder chain structure. Poly(phenylenediamine) can be used as adsorbent for heavy metal ions, demonstrating better adsorption performance than modified rice husk, crosslinked chitosan, grafted starch, and nanoporous activated carbon fiber and other traditional adsorbents. Poly(phenylenediamine) can be used to directly recover metal element for noble metal ions without electricity, and obtaining composite of organic polymers and nano noble metal. It can be further used as ionophore for lead ions in potentiometric sensor, with Nernstian response slope, wide detection concentration range, high selectivity, and long lifetime.",
