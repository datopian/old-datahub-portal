  "notes": "Unlike the traditional economic growth model, spatial contact must be noted when we construct relative models in the study of the relationship between logistics industry development and regional economic. With the use of space panel econometric model and CD production function, by constructing a regional logistics industry development and regional economic growth economic model, the study about the economic growth of China's provinces and the logistics industry during 1988-2009 is carried out. The results show that there are significant spatial correlation between Chinese province's economic growth and development of the logistics industry. 1 percent increase in the neighboring provinces logistics industry will make the province's GDP increase about 0.15 percent. Finally, according to estimations, some relevant policy recommendations are given.  http://www.emj-journal.org/paperInfo.aspx?ID=944",
