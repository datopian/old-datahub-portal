      "description": "Aeolian saltating cloud is the kernel of the aeolian physics research, also it is the important theory of geomorphology of wind-drift sand, desertification and the controlled engineering study of sand calamity. Aeolian saltating cloud study occupied an important position in wind-sand science research.The study method for aeolian saltating cloud have two ways: the microcosmic research and the macroscopic research. The microcosmic research mainly study the kinestate of single sand particle. Using the motion characters of the single sand particle to interpret the whole properties of the eaolian saltating cloud. The macroscopic research emphasize the whole structure and the dynamic process of Wind – sand flow. It include the structure of aeolian saltating cloud and its sand flux. This paper review the study history of aeolian saltating cloud in China and overseas, expatiate the study status currently, put forward the problems in this research, and prospect the research hotspot in future. I hope this paper will give some benefit to the researcher who study on the wind-sand science for grasping the trend of aeolian saltating cloud and improving the system of wind-sand science.",
