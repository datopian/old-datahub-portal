China’s current economic development mode faces the task of transformation. One of the ways to realize this task is to optimize the energy structure. Therefore, this paper divides energy into traditional energy and new energy. With the gray correlation analysis as the main research method, the energy consumption structure and economic development are analyzed. The results indicate that among energy consumption, new energy has an increasingly considerable influence on the economic development. Finally, the results are analyzed and related suggestions are put forward.",
