      "description": "This paper provides a computation on both the Chinaâ€™s aggregate CO2 emission volume and the emission of each sector over the period of 2002-2007, based on the input-output analysis. Further analysis is also given on the various determinants of the change in the emission volume, with the aid of structural decomposition approach based on a residual-free method. The changes in emission are analyzed in terms of five different factors. Among the five factors studied in the paper, it is found that emission intensity and domestic need are the main reasons for the decrease in emission, while production technology, trade structure and scale effect are the more significant causes to the increase in emission. It is also observed that although the direct emission intensity decreases during the study period, the complete emission intensity remains unchanged, which reflects the result of energy policy unequal in different sectors.\r\n",

      "description": "Energy dissipation in geological materials reinforced with geosynthetic is studied in this research. The behavior of building shallow foundation subjected to long period and short period earthquakes has been studied by numerical models prepared using MIDAS-GTS software. The models with multilayer geogrids below foundation are prepared. Time history analyses are then performed. Results are analyzed with the help of time history graphs and the three dimensional graphic display. Analyses are then done on the model of soil-geosynthetic-structure interaction with soil dynamic properties (stiffness) for different damping. The results obtained are interpreted and discussed.\r\n",
