Through the analysis of the mathematical models of BLDCM and combination of fuzzy control strategy and traditional PID control strategy, the modeling and simulation are done by the fuzzy control toolbox of MATLAB. The simulation results show that the fuzzy PID control speeds up response time, reduces the overshoot, and has strong robust and adaptive capacity, so it can make the system have better control performance and good application value.",
