  "notes": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA1\r\n\r\n  This archive contains 18,592 scientific publications totaling\r\n33GiB, all from Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\r\nand which should be  available to everyone at no cost, but most\r\nhave previously only been made available at high prices through\r\npaywall gatekeepers like JSTOR.\r\n\r\nLimited access to the  documents here is typically sold for $19\r\nUSD per article, though some of the older ones are available as\r\ncheaply as $8. Purchasing access to this collection one article\r\nat a time would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nAlso included is the basic factual metadata allowing you to\r\nlocate works by title, author, or publication date, and a\r\nchecksum file to allow you to check for corruption.\r\n\r\nef8c02959e947d7f4e4699f399ade838431692d972661f145b782c2fa3ebcc6a sha256sum.txt\r\n\r\nI've had these files for a long time, but I've been afraid that if I\r\npublished them I would be subject to unjust legal harassment by those who\r\nprofit from controlling access to these works.\r\n\r\nI now feel that I've been making the wrong decision.\r\n\r\nOn July 19th 2011, Aaron Swartz was criminally charged by the US Attorney\r\nGeneral's office for, effectively, downloading too many academic papers\r\nfrom JSTOR.\r\n\r\nAcademic publishing is an odd systemΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥the authors are not paid for their\r\nwriting, nor are the peer reviewers (they're just more unpaid academics),\r\nand in some fields even the journal editors are unpaid. Sometimes the\r\nauthors must even pay the publishers.\r\n\r\nAnd yet scientific publications are some of the most outrageously\r\nexpensive pieces of literature you can buy. In the past, the high access\r\nfees supported the costly mechanical reproduction of niche paper journals,\r\nbut online distribution has mostly made this function obsolete.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the money paid for access today serves little\r\nsignificant purpose except to perpetuate dead business models. The\r\n\"publish or perish\" pressure in academia gives the authors an impossibly\r\nweak negotiating position, and the existing system has enormous inertia.\r\n\r\nThose with the most power to change the system--the long-tenured luminary\r\nscholars whose works give legitimacy and prestige to the journals, rather\r\nthan the other way around--are the least impacted by its failures. They\r\nare supported by institutions who invisibly provide access to all of the\r\nresources they need. And as the journals depend on them, they may ask\r\nfor alterations to the standard contract without risking their career on\r\nthe loss of a publication offer. Many don't even realize the extent to\r\nwhich academic work is inaccessible to the general public, nor do they\r\nrealize what sort of work is being done outside universities that would\r\nbenefit by it.\r\n\r\nLarge publishers are now able to purchase the political clout needed\r\nto abuse the narrow commercial scope of copyright protection, extending\r\nit to completely inapplicable areas: slavish reproductions of historic\r\ndocuments and art, for example, and exploiting the labors of unpaid\r\nscientists. They're even able to make the taxpayers pay for their\r\nattacks on free society by pursuing criminal prosecution (copyright has\r\nclassically been a civil matter) and by burdening public institutions\r\nwith outrageous subscription fees.\r\n\r\nCopyright is a legal fiction representing a narrow compromise: we give\r\nup some of our natural right to exchange information in exchange for\r\ncreating an economic incentive to author, so that we may all enjoy more\r\nworks. When publishers abuse the system to prop up their existence,\r\nwhen they misrepresent the extent of copyright coverage, when they use\r\nthreats of frivolous litigation to suppress the dissemination of publicly\r\nowned works, they are stealing from everyone else.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I came into possession, through rather boring and\r\nlawful means, of a large collection of JSTOR documents.\r\n\r\nThese particular documents are the historic back archives of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal SocietyΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥a prestigious scientific\r\njournal with a history extending back to the 1600s.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the collection included in this archive, ones published\r\nprior to 1923 and therefore obviously in the public domain, total some\r\n18,592 papers and 33 gigabytes of data.\r\n\r\nThe documents are part of the shared heritage of all mankind,\r\nand are rightfully in the public domain, but they are not available\r\nfreely. Instead the articles are available at $19 each--for one month's\r\nviewing, by one person, on one computer. It's a steal. From you.\r\n\r\nWhen I received these documents I had grand plans of uploading them to\r\nWikipedia's sister site for reference works, WikisourceΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥ where they\r\ncould be tightly interlinked with Wikipedia, providing interesting\r\nhistorical context to the encyclopedia articles. For example, Uranus\r\nwas discovered in 1781 by William Herschel; why not take a look at\r\nthe paper where he originally disclosed his discovery? (Or one of the\r\nseveral follow on publications about its satellites, or the dozens of\r\nother papers he authored?)\r\n\r\nBut I soon found the reality of the situation to be less than appealing:\r\npublishing the documents freely was likely to bring frivolous litigation\r\nfrom the publishers.\r\n\r\nAs in many other cases, I could expect them to claim that their slavish\r\nreproductionΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥scanning the documentsΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥ created a new copyright\r\ninterest. Or that distributing the documents complete with the trivial\r\nwatermarks they added constituted unlawful copying of that mark. They\r\nmight even pursue strawman criminal charges claiming that whoever obtained\r\nthe files must have violated some kind of anti-hacking laws.\r\n\r\nIn my discreet inquiry, I was unable to find anyone willing to cover\r\nthe potentially unbounded legal costs I risked, even though the only\r\nunlawful action here is the fraudulent misuse of copyright by JSTOR and\r\nthe Royal Society to withhold access from the public to that which is\r\nlegally and morally everyone's property.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and to great fanfare as part of their 350th anniversary,\r\nthe RSOL opened up \"free\" access to their historic archivesΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥but \"free\"\r\nonly meant \"with many odious terms\", and access was limited to about\r\n100 articles.\r\n\r\nAll too often journals, galleries, and museums are becoming not\r\ndisseminators of knowledgeΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥as their lofty mission statements\r\nsuggestΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥but censors of knowledge, because censoring is the one thing\r\nthey do better than the Internet does. Stewardship and curation are\r\nvaluable functions, but their value is negative when there is only one\r\nsteward and one curator, whose judgment reigns supreme as the final word\r\non what everyone else sees and knows. If their recommendations have value\r\nthey can be heeded without the coercive abuse of copyright to silence \r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe liberal dissemination of knowledge is essential to scientific\r\ninquiry. More than in any other area, the application of restrictive\r\ncopyright is inappropriate for academic works: there is no sticky question\r\nof how to pay authors or reviewers, as the publishers are already not\r\npaying them. And unlike 'mere' works of entertainment, liberal access\r\nto scientific work impacts the well-being of all mankind. Our continued\r\nsurvival may even depend on it.\r\n\r\nIf I can remove even one dollar of ill-gained income from a poisonous\r\nindustry which acts to suppress scientific and historic understanding,\r\nthen whatever personal cost I suffer will be justifiedΓΓé¼ΓÇ¥it will be one\r\nless dollar spent in the war against knowledge. One less dollar spent\r\nlobbying for laws that make downloading too many scientific papers\r\na crime.\r\n\r\nI had considered releasing this collection anonymously, but others pointed\r\nout that the obviously overzealous prosecutors of Aaron Swartz would\r\nprobably accuse him of it and add it to their growing list of ridiculous\r\ncharges. This didn't sit well with my conscience, and I generally believe\r\nthat anything worth doing is worth attaching your name to.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in hearing about any enjoyable discoveries or even useful\r\napplications which come of this archive.\r\n\r\n- ---- \r\nGreg Maxwell - July 20th 2011\r\ngmaxwell@gmail.com  Bitcoin: 14csFEJHk3SYbkBmajyJ3ktpsd2TmwDEBb\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\r\n\r\niEYEARECAAYFAk4nlfwACgkQrIWTYrBBO/pK4QCfV/voN6IdZRU36Vy3xAedUMfz\r\nrJcAoNF4/QTdxYscvF2nklJdMzXFDwtF\r\n=YlVR\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n",
