Selecting 11 typical indicators, an evaluation model of college scientific research capacity and algorithm based on support vector machine is introduced. Firstly, support vector machine is introduced in brief; secondly, a new evaluation model based on support vector machine is established; at last, an algorithm for evaluation model based on the support vector machine is proposed. On this basis, the support vector machine algorithm for evaluation model is realized with MATLAB. 25 raw data areculled for the simulation experiments, in which 20 is considered as a training set, and other 15 as the testing set. Simulation results show that the rateof correct classification for the algorithm is 100%, so the algorithm achieves the desired goal.",
