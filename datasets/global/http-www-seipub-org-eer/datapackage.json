      "description": "In this paper an efficient automatic method for robust segmentation of finger vessel-network and vein pattern extraction from infrared images acquired by a low-cost monochrome or multichannel camera, is proposed. After brightness normalization, the fingerprint lines are eliminated using the 2D dimensional discrete wavelet transformation. A set of twelve directional kernels is constructed, based on a dyadic wavelet transform, for each scale and is used to enhance the directional properties of veins. From maximum filters’ response along scale and direction, a neighborhood thresholding derives a binary segmented image to produce reliable patterns of finger veins. A post-processing module is used in case where low-quality images are to be segmented. Preliminary evaluation experiments of the proposed method demonstrate a number of advantages, compared to recently published methods.",

      "description": "In this paper, we study the impact of heterogeneity on homogeneous protocols. Most of the protocols for increasing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks are designed for homogeneous networks. The load balancing protocol with adjustable sensing range (ALBPS) and deterministic energy efficient protocol with adjustable sensing range (ADEEPS), are two important homogeneous protocols. In this work, we incorporate 3-level heterogeneity to the ALBPS and ADEEPS and the resultant protocols are named as heterogeneous load balancing protocol with adjustable sensing range (HALBPS) and heterogeneous deterministic energy efficient protocol with adjustable sensing range (HADEEPS), respectively. We compare the performance of the ALBPS and ADEEPS protocols with that of the HALBPS and HADEEPS protocols. The simulation results indicate that the heterogeneous protocols further prolong the network lifetime.\r\n",

The process provides anisotropic etch profiles and high etch rates >240 nm/ min at moderate light intensities ~17.3 mW/cm2 @237 nm in the H3PO4 (pH=1.09) solution. The etch rate and photocurrent are characterized as a concentration of the stirred solutions. In this work, two types of metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures were fabricated. One is the semiconductor layer with as-grown n-GaN (Sample B), and the other is the n-GaN surface with photo-electro-chemical etching (Sample A). The oxide layer for both these devices were fabricated using silicon dioxide insulator grown by a low-temperature (30-40℃) and reliable method of liquid phase deposition (LPD). For an incident light wavelength of 366 nm with an intensity of 4.15 mW/cm2 and a 6 V reverse bias, it was found that the photo to dark current ratio was around 31 and 26 for sample A and B, respectively. The photo to dark current ratio of sample A increases 19.2% compares with sample B.\r\n",
