      "description": "Display and Control System is a kind of large scale automatic systems that integrate with the processing of video/audio signal and information. It has been implemented in many control centers all over China. Display and Control Group is a group of Display and Control Systems in control centers, which can be understood as an algebra system defined by mathematic methods. The control system in the Group is transferring from distributed-control to hidden-control, which means that the controllers consisting of the control system disappear and hide in the equipment. To meet the needs of the control system, two control structures are discussed in this paper. The method of how the control system works for self-organization and self-reconstruction in the Display and Control Group is proposed. The result shows that the structures are feasible through emulation experiment. These hidden controllers form a large scale automatic system, and make a group of equipment communicate and complete the task themselves.",
