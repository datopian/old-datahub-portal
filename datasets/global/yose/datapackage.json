Produced by the National Park Service, this series features park rangers, scientists, historians and park visitors as they discuss the diverse plants and animals that make Yosemite their home, as well as the towering cliffs, giant waterfalls and mountain peaks that are known throughout the world.\r\n\r\n## Openness\r\n\r\n> Information presented on this website, unless otherwise indicated , is considered in the public domain.
