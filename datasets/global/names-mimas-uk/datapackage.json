  "notes": "About:\r\n\r\n> The Names Project is funded by JISC as part of the Information Environment Programme's Shared Infrastructure Services Strand. It is a collaboration between Mimas and the British Library.\r\n\r\n> The project began in 2007 and was initially funded to investigate requirements for a name authority service for UK repositories of research outputs. A prototype name authority system was developed as part of this work and a number of connections have been made with UK stakeholders and with international projects working in a similar space.\r\n\r\n> The project team are now working to further develop the name authority prototype into a form that will be useful for repository services, using a variety of data sources. We are keen to work with developers of systems that would make use of a name authority service and are also interested to hear from owners of data that would help us to improve the information that the Names prototype contains.",
