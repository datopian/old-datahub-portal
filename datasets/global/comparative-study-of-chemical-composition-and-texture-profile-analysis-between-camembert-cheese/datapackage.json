      "description": "Chinese sufu and camembert cheese were similar in the proc essing technology and final appearan ce. The study was a comparative analysis of common soft ripened cheeses and Chinese traditional fermented soybean products on the market. The result of chemical analyses revealed that cheese’s moisture(61.63%), pH(6.41), protein(23.16%), and fat(24.33%)were higher than sufu’s moisture(52.76%), pH(6.31), protein(14.87%) and fat(10.34%), while cheese’s amino acid nitrogen(1.36mg/g) and salt(1.21%) were lower than sufu’s amino acid nitrogen (6.64 mg/g) and salt (8.21%). Although Chinese sufu’s the total amoun t of free amino acids (147.93mg/g) were lower th an camembert cheese’ (90.28mg/g), the types were more complete. Texture profile analysis of the camembert cheese and Chinese sufu showed that all of the indicators of cheese we re higher than sufu. The chewiness (81.23g) , adhesiveness (-42.24g.sec), c ohesiveness (0.69), springiness (0.75) and resilience (0.27) were higher than the sufu’s chewiness (29.65g), adhesiveness (-281.52 g.sec), cohesiveness (0.45), springiness (0.65) and resilience (0.084), and the significant difference was very. However, the hardness of cheese (155.89g) and sufu (95.10g) was significant difference.\r\n",
