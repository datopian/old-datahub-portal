      "description": "The effect of drying temperature on drying rates of RDX was investigated at different temperature. The increasing of temperature ranging from 60 to 90℃ dramatically contributed to the improvement of drying rate as well as a significant decrease in drying time. The experimental drying data were applied to 10 various thin-layer drying models. Among the proposed models, Midilli-Kucuk model was the best for characterizing drying behavior of RDX for the whole range of temperature. The variations of these models parameters with temperature were described as Arrhenius and Logarithmic type function of drying temperature. A series of model equations disclosing the temperature and time dependence of static drying of RDX was derived, which were determined by multiple regression analysis. Model 35 derived from Two term model has the lowest RMSE, MBE and chi-square and the highest modeling efficiency and regression coefficient. The moisture ratio change during static drying of RDX in the temperature range of 60-90℃ was also put forward.",
