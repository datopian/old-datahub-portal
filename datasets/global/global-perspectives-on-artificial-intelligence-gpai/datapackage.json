      "description": "Artificial intelligence needs methods for object modeling having the set of key points. A novel method of Hurwitz- Radon Matrices (MHR) is used in signature modeling. Proposed method is based on the family of Hurwitz-Radon (HR) matrices which possess columns composed of orthogonal vectors. Two-dimensional curve as signature is modeling via different functions as probability distribution functions: polynomial, sinus, cosine, tangent, cotangent, logarithm, exponent, arc sin, arc cos, arc tan and power function. It is shown how to build the orthogonal matrix OHR operator and how to use it in a process of signature modeling.\r\n",

      "description": " Robot Motion control represents a major problem when developing efficient robotic control system. Linear motion controllers such as PD or PID are widely used for most of applications because they have straightforward structures and tuning procedures. It was approved that Fuzzy controllers highly enhance the control system performance but they require a complex or not systematic tuning and implementation. This paper introduces a systematic approach for developing efficient Fuzzy-PD controller for 3DOF robot arm. This approach is based on mapping a linear PD controller structure into nonlinear Fuzzy-PD structure. The approach is based on the mapping formulas developed by Jantzen. The Fuzzy PD experimental evaluation shows a high minimization of the tracking error for various applied trajectories",

      "description": "Simulation of Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) of oil from pomegranate seeds using Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO2) was investigated to study the influence of process parameters on the extraction rate and oil composition. Yield predictions of the pomegranate seed oil production outbreaks from input vectors of our experiments may help us to interpret well to find optimized operating condition to achieve high yields. Intelligent systems are perfect tools for prediction in such systems with numerous effective factors that each one can change the experimental output answers maybe against expect. Our effort in this paper is to find a route and effective way to evaluate and predict the yield of seed oil production at different operational conditions without paying extra costs and spending more times by using intelligent systems. Several approaches to predict the pomegranate seed oil extraction with fuzzy sets; neural and adaptive fuzzy neural systems are analyzed and tested. Prediction strategies tested in the paper include the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, the common neural networks (NN) and application of fuzzy neural networks. The results indicate the superiority of the adaptive fuzzy neural networks method over common neural network and fuzzy clustering approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy neural network algorithm is able to reveal a better performance than conventional back propagation NN and FCM algorithms.\r\n",
