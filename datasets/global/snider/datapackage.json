  "notes": "All expatriates are bound by expatriate tax rules. The expatriates living abroad have a legal obligation to  submit IRS forms each year as per expatriate tax rules and they can avail exclusions as per set expatriate tax rules.\nWhile filing  income tax returns, the expatriates should file the 1040 form if they intend to get exemption by  satisfying the  requirements as per expatriate tax rules. Even if you  undergo taxation in the residing  nation on all or part of your  earnings, you are still liable to pay United States income tax. However, one can avail foreign credits that can  provide relief from tax burden. Of course, if the  nation you  reside in has a  greater rate of  tax you will get more credits,  instead of  nations where there is little or no tax that you  should pay.\nAmerican expats that come under the IRS expatriate tax rules  frequently  have to disclose foreign  earnings and bank accounts by law to  avoid  undesirable consequences.

Earnings not reported are not taxed and this results in less tax revenue for the government. The IRS applies FBAR penalties and fines on  lawbreakers if they fail to  follow the FBAR reporting guidelines. In an effort to cut down on the tax gap, the IRS insists on taxpayers who earn foreign income to file foreign tax returns on time.\nThere are various compliance  regulations and requirements that taxpayers who own foreign accounts and who  make foreign income  should adhere to while filing foreign tax returns.
