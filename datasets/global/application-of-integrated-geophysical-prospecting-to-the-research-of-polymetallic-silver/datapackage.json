      "description": " Geophysical prospecting plays an important role in each stage of minerals resources exploration, especially in punctuating favorable metallogenic area, studying ore-controlling structure and mine specialization deposit. Geophysics prospecting is commonly used in indirect exploration for its multiplicity of solutions in inversion, so it is the basic method of integrated geophysical prospecting to improve the uniqueness of solution. Based on the theory and effect of each method, author analyses what the geological problems the different combinations could solve in different stages of geological exploration, which has instructive effects on forecasting the metallogenic location and optimization of targets. Research results show that the combination of low resistivity, high magnetics, high polarizability and surface alteration is the combined features of ore body existing in research area, and it is the optimization targets of high-grade ore zone in fault assemblage or intersection of anomaly belt. For the impregnated sulfide deposit containing pyrrhotite, the combination of area IP and high magnetic measurement have directly instructive signification to study the tectonic framework and fracture distribution and find the local metallogenic anomaly zones. The combination of IP sounding, AMT, and SIP is the fundamental method of exploration of deep geology.",
