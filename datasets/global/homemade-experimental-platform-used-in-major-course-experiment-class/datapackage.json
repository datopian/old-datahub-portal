      "description": " This paper discusses the effect of homemade experiment instrument in the laboratory construction and the experimental teaching reform. Firstly this paper analyzes the necessity and feasibility of the homemade experiment platform. Then taking embedded motor control experimental platform as an example, it introduces the operation of the Institute of automation, whose teachers combine scientific research with practical teaching and turn the achievements into laboratory construction and students' practical teaching to initiative the students’ study interest. By changing the teaching concept, introducing new teaching mode, improving the experimental approaches and combing with the basic theory of embedded motor control, theory teaching and experimental teaching are integrated organically via the homemade experiment platform. Thus, students can better master the relevant knowledge of motor control, and their innovation ability and comprehensive abilities can be strengthened.",
