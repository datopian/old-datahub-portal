  "notes": "Climate change has great effects on hydrological processes, which has been a hot topic during the researches with respect to hydrology and water resources. However, it is unavoidable that many uncertainty factors are generated during the process of assessing the effect. Based on the process for the effect assessment of climate change to hydrology, the sources of uncertainti es can be divided to two categories that are the uncertainties in the process of climate prediction and the uncertainties in the process of hydrological evaluation. Afterwards, the specific uncertainties belong to two main uncertainties are illustrated in detail. At last, according to the researchs related to the uncertainty problem of climate change and hydrological modeling, the methods used in these researches are summarized in this paper.\r\nhttp://www.ivypub.org/fes/paperInfo.aspx?ID=2811",
