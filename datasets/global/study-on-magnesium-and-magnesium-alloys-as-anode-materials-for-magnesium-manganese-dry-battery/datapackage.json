Electrochemical tests were conducted on AZ31 alloy with phytic acid of different concentrations as the corrosion inhibitor, is investigated by, and battery assembly was conducted under different concentrations. The results show that the alloy decreases corrosion of magnesium, and AZ31 alloy has a good eletrochemical performance; Phytic acid has a degree of inhibiting ability, the concentration of 0.1 percent is the best, increasing the capacity of the battery and improving the utilization rate of the anode.",
