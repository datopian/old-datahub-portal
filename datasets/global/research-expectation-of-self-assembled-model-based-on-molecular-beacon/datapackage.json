      "description": "DNA computing using Self-Assembly and its model based on molecular beacon has been the focus in the research of DNA Computing in the recent years. Self-Assembled DNA computing is the result of the combination of DNA Computing, the theory of tiling and nanotechnology, and moreover, molecular beacon has the advantages of simple structure, high sensitivity, easily-measured and fast reaction rate. The combination of molecular beacon and Self-Assembly will provide a new effective method of studying DNA Computing. Introduce the significance of research about Self-Assembled model based on molecular beacon, researchful actuality of Self-Assembled DNA computing model and DNA computing model based on molecular beacon, as well as researchful track of Self-Assembled model based on molecular beacon. The first of all, research about the characteristics of structure about molecular beacon and its capacity of the information expressed and handled, the deep research on the assembly rules about the theory of Self-Assembled DNA computing and optimal design, discuss the Self-Assembled methods of molecular beacon and its complexity analysis in detail, create its model. Secondly, establish the Self-Assembled model based on molecular beacon, which contains many combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, we make a further discussion on the advantages and the disadvantages about Self-Assembled model based on molecular beacon in order to design a new model with universality.",
