It is the most detailed version of GPW to date with more than three times the amount of data as version 2, and includes population estimates to 2015. GRUMP builds on GPWv3 by incorporating urban and rural information, allowing new insights into urban population distribution and the global extents of human settlements.\r\n>\r\n> Developed between 2003 and 2005, GPWv3 and GRUMP provide globally consistent and spatially explicit human population information and data for use in research, policy making, and communications. GRUMP is currently in its alpha edition. Check back in early 2006 for updates. For more information, please see the projectsâ€™ Description and History. We appreciate user feedback, including  copies of published papers and maps that use our data; please review the data usage policy.
