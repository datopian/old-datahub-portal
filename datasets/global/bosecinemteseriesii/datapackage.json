  "notes": "There are certain brand names that are associated with quality or making the best products in their fields. Want a quality TV? Give us a Sony any day. If the gophers want some chocolate, they prefer Nestle. Well, when it comes to “Quality” speakers, Bose is usually the first name to come to most people’s minds. Every time we get to check out a Bose Digital Home Theater we get happy, and while we may get a little “sticker shock” we are never disappointed.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gopherreviews.com/bose-cinemate-series-ii-review\">Bose CineMate Series II</a>",
