It currently comprised 24 members.\n\nDAC Statistics measure official and private flows from DAC donors, multilateral organisations and other donors to about 150 developing countries and territories.\n\nThe DAC publishes statistics and reports on aid and other resource flows to developing countries, based principally on reporting by DAC Members, multilateral organisations and other donors. \n\nMonitoring financial flows and their allocation is an important aspect of the Development Assistance Committee's programme of work. The DAC Working Party on Statistics brings international aid statisticians together to look at how statistics respond to key development issues.",

To see project data, click on the magnifying glasses on the table. This feature only shows the first 1000 projects. Selecting the whole table and copying to Excel seems to be the only way to capture this data.\nAll project data from one year can be exported through the \"related files\" button along the top.
