They are sharing information and data on food aid transactions.\r\n\r\n> All information is cross-checked before being disseminated. The comprehensive and integrated database allows the monitoring of food aid allocations and shipments for the purpose of improving food aid management, coordination, reporting and statistical analysis. The database is updated on a continuing basis. Therefore, data can change as allocation plans and delivery schedules are subject to modifications. Data since 1988 is available.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nPresumed to be open, but no explicit information found.",
