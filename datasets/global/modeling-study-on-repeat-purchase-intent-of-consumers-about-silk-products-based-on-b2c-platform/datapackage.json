Based on the electronic commerce flat, in this paper, we put forward the customer purchase on the net of silk products repeat purchase intent research project design, the factor analysis, and purchase intent forecast model accepted by the most scholars generally. This paper mainly explores the e-commerce purchase frequency (EPF), customer perceived value (CPV), perceived risk of e-commerce (EPR), customer satisfaction (CS), the influence of this four factors on repeat purchase intent (RPI). The results found that CPV, CS, these two factors have positive correlation with repeat purchase intention, and EPR has negative correlation with RPI, EPF have no significant influence relations with RPI. The result can provide reasonable suggestions on the construction of silk shop and sales domestic.",
