  "notes": "From [home page](http://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/):\r\n\r\n> The aim of the Roman Provincial Coinage series is to produce a standard typology of the provincial coinage of the Roman Empire from its beginning in 44 BC to its end in AD 296/7. The current Roman Provincial Coinage Online project is confined to the Antonine period (AD 138â€“192), but it is intended that it will form a model for putting other periods online in the future.\r\n>\r\n> The database is based on the ten most important and accessible collections in the world, and on all published material. It comprises one of the largest collections of images and related inscriptions from the ancient world which is searchable by iconography, place, and time.\r\n>\r\n> The database contains information on 13,729 coin types, based on 46,725 specimens (9,061 of which have images).\r\n\r\n### Openness: NOT OPEN\r\n\r\nUse and reuse limited to education.
