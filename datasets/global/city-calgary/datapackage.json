  "notes": "### About\r\n\r\nIn July [there were reports](http://djkelly.ca/2009/07/open-government-coming-to-calgary/) of a proposed motion to open up the City of Calgary's data. In particular the motion says:\r\n\r\n> Identification of opportunities to make more of The City’s data open and accessible while respecting privacy and security concerns , and ensuring that data is available through use of open standards, interfaces and formats\r\n\r\nAt time of writing it is not clear whether any datasets have been made available yet.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nAs [one commentator points out](http://blog.mastermaq.ca/2009/07/21/calgary-takes-first-steps-toward-becoming-an-open-city/), the motion does not explicitly mention licensing:\r\n\r\n> One issue that isn’t mentioned in Calgary’s motion but which is very important, is licensing. It’s important that when Calgary does make data available, that it does so in the least restrictive way possible. Either public domain, or creative commons, or something similar. It would be a shame if they made a ton of data available and then had ridiculous terms of use around it.",
