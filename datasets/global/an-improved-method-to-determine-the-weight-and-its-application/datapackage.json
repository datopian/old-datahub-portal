We ascertain the weight according to both of the objective methods and the subjective methods, that is to say the membership function is based on attribute measures along with the calculation of entropy and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is established by the fuzzy rules decided by weight computing. With the evaluation of performance for highway pavement, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation system is built based on FIS toolbox in MATLAB. The evaluation method is proved to be feasible and effective through the analyses of real cases. The evaluation method presented by this paper is of instructive significance, which gains an ideal effect and is quite to the factual conditions.",
