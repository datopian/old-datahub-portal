      "description": "The mathematical model for evaluation on the economy of energy consumption and parametric sensitivity of bus whose driving force is just electricity was established as well as the standard of economic consumption, based on the definition made on conventional assessment on the economic consumption of combustion motor. According to the actual driving demand of electric bus, the paper analyzed the energy consumption under the accelerating/coasting mode, and verified the feasibility of the model by comparing the test results of simulation and real vehicle. Finally, the paper simulated the vehicle energy consumption trends under condition of acceleration, and then analyzed the parametric sensitivity of the economy of energy consumption. The results of this paper provide the scientific basis for optimization of power system and improvement on the fuel economy of battery electric bus.\r\n",
