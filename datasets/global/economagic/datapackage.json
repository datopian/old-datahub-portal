  "notes": "### Description\r\n\r\nA large collection of USA time series data taken from a variety of sources, primarily state and central government in the USA.\r\n\r\nFrom the about page <http://www.economagic.com/about/>:\r\n\r\n> This page is meant to be a comprehensive site of free, easily available economic time series data useful for economic research, in particular economic forecasting. This site (set of web pages) was started in 1996 to help students in an Applied Forecasting class. The idea was to give students easy access to large amounts of data, and to be able to quickly get charts of that data. This is also useful during class, so that when we use the computer and overhead projector facility in class, we can quickly retrieve series and do manipulations in class.\r\n> \r\n> At this time, there are more than 100,000 time series for which data and custom charts can be retrieved. Though the greatest utility of this site is the vast number of economic time series, and the easily modified charts of that same data, an overlooked facility of great utility is the availability of Excel files for all series.\r\n> \r\n> The majority of the data is USA data. The core data sets involve US macroeconomic data (that is, for the whole US), but the bulk of the data is employment data by local area -- state, county, MSA, and many cities and towns. \r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\n  * License: none specified but states that data is freely available and given sources seem to be mainly US government should be public domain. However should check each dataset's sources individually.\r\n  * Access: each series can be downloaded easily from series web page either in xls or plain text format.\r\n    * format: xls;txt",
