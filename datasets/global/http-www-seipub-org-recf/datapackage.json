      "description": "This paper discusses a support system of Kaizen activity for effective sharing useful cases among multi-site factories. After the framework of the support system which consists of three basic elements, that is, Kaizen case-base, model-base and user-interface, is described quoted by Decision Support System (DSS), a design of a procedure of new case development which is put in the user-interface particularly is the focus. Furthermore, Kaizen technology applied to the new case development is Visual Management (VM) technology as one of the useful technologies. The proposed procedure consists of the following five phases: 1) identification of current burden, 2) selection of useful case, 3) new case design for improving direct burden, 4) improved designed case for enhancement of technological level and 5) improved designed case for contribution to overall system. In addition, a case study is performed to assure the relevance of the proposed procedure by put the emphasis on VM of chemical plant. Then the proposed procedure is qualified based on systematic evaluation and expertsâ€™ opinion as useful method to Kaizen knowledge transfer through collaboration with a factory eager to implement VM.",

      "description": "The goal of this paper is to present and analyse the potential of E-learning and computerized adaptive testing, as a part of it, within a corporate context. Over the years, technological growth led to creation of learning organizations and knowledge economy so the solution for constant and cost-effective training of staff had to be found. That is where E-learning proved to be one of the most efficient solutions in a business organization. In the paper, features and segments of corporate E-learning will be presented. Meanwhile, fundamentals of computerized adaptive testing, item response theory and algorithm procedure are going to be described. Finally, potential of computerized adaptive testing used in determining employees knowledge and skills development is going to be discussed.\r\n",
