The origins of different cordyceps sinensis infecting the host larvae and cordyceps sinensis infection in different host insect was observed in larvae infection to give an analysis on that basis. The results show that, strains of cordyceps sinensis from Xiaojin county have the highest infection rate of 72.22%, strains of cordyceps sinensis from Tibet has a minimum of 45.56%; H.gonggaensis has the highest infection rate of 75.56% with H. biruensis infection rate of the lowest 58.89% and the non-infection of H. jianchuanensis; cordyceps fruiting bodies have in different regions have no real substance difference except for ophiocordyceps laojunshanensis. In conclusion, cordyceps sinensis infection ability differs in different origins.",
