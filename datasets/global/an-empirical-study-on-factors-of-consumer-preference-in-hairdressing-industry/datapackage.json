      "description": "Currently, there is rare systematic study on the factors that make an influence on consumer preference in hairdressing industry. Firstly, 17 factors of consumer preference in hairdressing industry are selected to compile a questionnaire, a sample survey is carried out by means of a questionnaire composed of 17 factors selected from the factors affecting consumer preference on mainstream consumer groups of hairdressing industry in Baoding, and then, internal consistency test is employed to examine the 17 factors in the questionnaire by using Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, showing good internal consistency of the questionnaire. Based on the valid questionnaires received, six primary factors of consumer preference are achieved by means of a principal component analysis with the help of SPSS for the 17 factors namely, the scale of store, image staff, attitude of barbers, prices, convenience of traffic and skills of barbers. Finally, some countermeasures are proposed based on the six main impact factors. Conclusions of this paper can direct hairdressing industry to tell the most important factors and take appropriate measures to improve their competitive ability.",
