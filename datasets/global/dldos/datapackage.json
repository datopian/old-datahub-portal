  "notes": "### Description\r\n\r\nExcerpted from: <http://attrition.org/dataloss/dldos.html>\r\n\r\n> Since July of 2005, attrition.org has been tracking data loss and data theft incidents (whether confirmed, unconfirmed, or disputed) not just from the United States, but across the world. This list includes incidents that may or may not have resulted in information exposure. Our archives go back to the year 2000, and with over 136 MILLION records compromised in over 300 incidents across six years (as of August 30, 2006), we would finally like to introduce a very basic and rudimentiary database that will assist others in tracking these incidents.\r\n>\r\n> DLDOS (Data Loss Database - Open Source) is a simple flat comma seperated value file that can be imported into your database of choice, whether it be MySQL, Microsoft Access, or Oracle (good luck). We provide the date, the company that reported the breach, the type of data impacted, the number of records impacted, third party companies involved, and a few other sortable items that may be of interest. At this point, attrition.org is not hosting an actual database itself, but the raw data is free and available for non-commercial use as long as attrition.org is credited for the use of said data. Really, we're not trying to be jerks, but if you're going to use our data in your research, be it a web site or paper written for a commercial entity, please contact us. A key for DLDOS is also available.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Openness: NOT OPEN\r\n\r\nLicense: at bottom of <http://attrition.org/dataloss/>:\r\n\r\n> Copyright 2005-2008 by attrition.org.
