Starting from the mathematical model of BLDCM, this paper presents a control model of vehicle BLDCM speed servo system combined with the adaptive look-up table feedforward control algorithm. Simulation results have proved that compared with the traditional PI controller, adding the adaptive look-up table feedforward control can enhance the control accuracy and improve resistance to the variation of loads. Meanwhile, due to the online automatic update of the table, the influence of motor parameters variation can be eliminated.",
