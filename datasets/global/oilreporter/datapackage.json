Very public.\r\nCheck out our privacy statement.\r\n\r\nAlso have a very detailed [terms of service](http://oilreporter.org/tos) which are very clear that contributors license the data to crisis commons but does not seem to state what situation is for those wanting to get the data from crisis commons.",
