      "description": "Optimum stimulation level theory (OSLT) is a fairly influential theory with strong explanatory power. It establishes the relationships between individuals’ physio-psychological factors and cognitive/emotional/attitudinal/behavioral responses. It also provides insightful guidance for understanding the different patterns and characteristics in individuals’ daily and working life. This paper introduces the theoretical assumptions and main ideas of OSLT, and reviews the relevant confirmative studies as well as its main applications. Based on the comparison among three types of measurement scales and their different versions, this paper recommends Arousal Seeking Tendency II, Change Seeker Index and its short version. Several future studies have been identified, including the role of age, the internal processes and mechanisms. In addition, this paper points out that it is necessary to develop measurement scales upon different contexts and subjects, and to extend the theory to different research contexts and areas by combining with other relevant theories.\r\n",
