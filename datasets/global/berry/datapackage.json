  "notes": "For those of us who create and submit articles to various content directories, we do so mainly for 1 explanation:To get the hyperlink back to our website.However, its crucial to keep in thoughts that not all links are equal in the eyes of the key search engines.How your hyperlinks seem to the search engines can be almost as substantial as the quantity of hyperlinks that truly point to your website.\n\nAs you cultivate links to your internet site, the aim is to have as organic a hyperlink structure as possible.What this indicates is that search engines like to see hyperlinks presented in a manner that does not appear to be phony, or an effort to fool the search engines into pondering your website is more well-known than it actually is.In our efforts to do this, it is essential to hold in thoughts the following:\n\nInitial, your incoming hyperlinks ought to improve steadily.Search engines see a sudden jump in links as artificial and not an indication of your internet sites popularity.When you submit your articles to an write-up directory, your links generally increase gradually as they are picked up more than time and published on internet web sites and archived ezines.\n\nSecond, whenever achievable, your incoming hyperlinks ought to not be reciprocal.Many of you are now saying, easier mentioned than accomplished.Possibly, but submitting articles to write-up directories is a fantastic way to construct these types of links.\n\nSearch engines view internet sites that rely heavily on reciprocal hyperlinks as not necessarily containing sought-following content material that other individuals want to voluntarily link to.That is, pure hyperlink reciprocity implies that the only objective of the hyperlink is to create links and has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the content on the web site.\n\nThird, its quite crucial to be consistent in how the link to your site is published.The following example will illustrate this point:\n\nThe following URLs all point to the exact same web page, of course.Nevertheless, as far as the key search engines are concerned, they are all distinct:\n\nhttp://articlelists.com\n\nhttp://articlelists.com/\n\nhttp://articlelists.com/index.html\n\nhttp://www.articlelists.com\n\nhttp://www.articlelists.com/\n\nhttp://www.articlelists.com/index.html\n\nFor that reason, if your incoming hyperlinks differ as listed above, your web page rank is getting watered down by up to a aspect of six.So if you are not already doing it, be confident to be constant in how you have your incoming links published.\n\nThis final item discussed here concerns anchor text.Anchor text is the actual text that appears for a distinct hyperlink, and is perhaps one of the most important troubles to consider when building your incoming link structure. My aunt discovered <a href=\"http://www.mabesbola.com/\">taruhan bola</a> by browsing the Dallas Star. For instance, in the following hyperlink, Free Write-up Directory, the words Free Report Directory constitute the anchor text.Nevertheless, when you place your cursor over the hyperlink you will see the destination site, www.ArticleLists.com, displayed in the status bar.\n\nThere are two important guidelines of thumb to remember about your anchor text.The initial is that your anchor text ought to differ.That is, the incoming hyperlinks to your web site ought to not all have the same anchor text. This creates a a lot more all-natural appearance to the search engines and will aid in your rankings.The second rule is to spot your keywords and phrases into your anchor text anytime achievable.The cause this is crucial is since search engines view the anchor text as an indication of the topic of your webpage. So you get a two-for-1 effect:You not only get the preferred inbound link, but you also create a a lot more natural-searching incoming hyperlink structure which will be viewed more favorably by the search engines.Of course, you would very first want to do some keyword investigation to decide the reputation and value of a variety of keywords and phrases relating to your internet site, and then use the ones for which you are trying to rank nicely.\n\nWhen you start to view your inbound hyperlink structure from the viewpoint of the search engines, you start to see the logic of what requirements to be done to rank nicely.For the search engines, its all about content and delivering the most relevant web pages achievable for a offered search term.\n\nMaking an inbound hyperlink structure that seems more natural, or voluntary, will indicate to the search engines that your content material is certainly one thing that their users would locate helpful.Assuming your website publishes quality content material, you have, in a sense, helped the search engine do their job and in the process youve gone a long way in making your net internet site a lot more visible on the World wide web.",
