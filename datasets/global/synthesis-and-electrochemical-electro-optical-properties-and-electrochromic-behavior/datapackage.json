The corresponding polymer films were successfully synthesized via electropolymerization. The structures of these compounds were characterized and ensured by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS and FT-IR. The corresponding polymer films were successfully synthesized via electropolymerization in three-electrode system. Their spectroelectrochemical properties, electrochromic behavior, thermal stability, surface morphology, and fluorescence were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, UV-VIS absorption, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence emission spectra. The results show that these polymer films have excellent spectroelectrochemical and electrochromic properties.",
