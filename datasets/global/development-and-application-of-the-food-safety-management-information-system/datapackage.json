Using ArcIMS secondary development and visualization, it brought forward the efficient management of information and decision functions. Through the establishment of three levels of supervision and retrospective network about agricultural products quality and safety in Chaoyang District, it integrated monitor, trace, query, early warning. Via whole-process supervision and video surveillance of agricultural product quality in the production, processing, circulation, and other aspects, the system enhanced data collection, data analysis, statistics, market and early warning, risk assessment, quality tracing, emergency response capability.",
