  "notes": "A few years ago while sitting on a table outside my work-place I observed two birds playing around making a myriad of sound. Dig up new resources on the affiliated web site by visiting <a href=\"http://angrybirds4u.com/what-is-angry-birds/\">angry bird</a>. One was much bigger compared to the other was so I thought that she was the caretaker trying to give her young. I could not believe that the tiny bird, a lovely little sparrow, was jumping up an down trying to place food in the mouth of this ungrateful screeching little big bird who did just keep his mouth open and run around as if h-e was not getting enough to eat. <a href=\"http://angrybirds4u.com/angry-birds-rio/\">Visit Link</a> contains new information concerning when to look at this thing. The mother was exhausted from all of this jumping about. I thought I'd give the mother a break and throw some breadcrumbs around for them to share. You think the 'Baby' bird would give itself - NO! It however waited for Mom to jump up and put the morsels in its mouth. If this were the true mother of this monster bird, then I'd hate to find out the daddy! I have heard about birds laying their eggs in 'foreign' nests nevertheless the least they could do is choose a surrogate mother their very own size! \n\nSince then I have been reading up o-n 'brood parasites' - that's what they call these deadbeat parents who leave it up to other birds to raise their babies. Click here <a href=\"http://angrybirds4u.com/angry-birds-cheats/\">angry birds cheats</a> to explore the purpose of it. The one hottest in the Americas seems to be the Brown-headed Cowbird which is really a fairly big bird compared to the sparrow. To help out the sparrow I decided to go in-to real estate - wild bird real estate that is: bird properties and feeders, plus fountains and baths. By doing this the sparrow can move around in a small holed birdhouse and perhaps not be worried about a bird arriving and laying its eggs on her to raise. She may bring up her own little sparrows the way nature intended.",
