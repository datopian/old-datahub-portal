  "notes": "I've located that there are a number of areas where you can leave your vehicle nearby airports that can make airport parking quite simple. They will shuttle you more than to the airport after you park and get you when you return.\n\n..\n\nI travel a lot and there is usually the question of how to get to the airport, should I leave my vehicle there or take a cab. The question of no matter whether I will I ask a friend to drive me the airport if I have a 7 am flight is often a challenging question to answer.\n\nI've identified that there are a number of places exactly where you can leave your automobile nearby airports that can make airport parking quite straightforward. They will shuttle you over to the airport after you park and get you when you return.\n\nFor instance if you are going to Fort Lauderdale Airport there is the Airport Park N Go which is 1.two miles from the airport. They supply free transportation and luggage assistance to and from the terminals.An additional option is Continental Airport Parking which is quite close to the airport.A third alternative is Airport Park N Go and a fourth is Park N Fly. There is also the Sheraton Hotel which has some parking concepts.\n\nThey also have a shared ride service for $15.00 at Fort Lauderdale, Miami International and West Palm Beach airports exactly where roughly 4 men and women are sharing a auto. Clicking <a href=\"http://luxurycarhireeurope.com/rentals/Audi_Munich_Germany\">audi hire munich website</a> perhaps provides lessons you can tell your boss. Depending on the other passengers and the order which you are in, it can be up to two hours when you'll get property. Still this can be a excellent way to go and it is handy and proper at the terminal.\n\nWhen you leave your auto at a designated spot for airport parking nearby, some areas have covered parking and outdoor options and the prices differ so it is excellent to check and compare and choose for your self what works finest for your price range. You can also decide on no matter whether or not you want to use the economic climate parking at the airport. For instance, albany airport has an inexpensive economy parking lot. In particular regions you want to check the lighting in the parking lots, how usually the shuttle runs and if you get help with luggage or not.\n\nAdditionally some vehicle rental or even vehicle repairs centers will make an arrangement for parking so that is another thing to investigate when you are looking for a location to park and save a tiny cash. Normally parking for a week will have a discount cost so usually enquire about that.\n\nNow I no longer really feel awkward asking somebody for a ride for an early morning or late flight due to the fact the airport parking options are much extremely convenient. You can discover these around most airports.",
