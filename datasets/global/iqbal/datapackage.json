  "notes": "On the one particular hand I don't want to have to submit far more than one particular post a day, I use a posting utility but yet I nevertheless have to log in to every website and submit to every single site. But on the other hand there are days when I come up with a lot of distinct subjects, distinct suggestions, that would make fantastic articles. I have developed a particular directory to maintain these articles organized but there nonetheless is the issue of obtaining to open an report and utilizing the copy and paste function obtaining to copy and paste the subject, the article physique and then having to go by means of my report for the keywords and phrases.\n\nI have a great remedy that solves all of this. I am making use of a totally free utility where I can produce articles on my desktop and with a click of a button that write-up will be automatically posted to my blog. Now when it comes time to submit yet another report I will just submit a single of these posts from my weblog. If you want to ever know what utilities I use just e-mail me and I will inform you. I utilized to consist of all of these in my articles, posts, but some of these write-up directories then think I am advertising these goods and they never approve my write-up.\n\nI have discovered this past week that writing and submitting articles is the fastest way to become recognized as an authority. I designed several articles this previous weekend and submitted them proper away. This was on Saturday and by Tuesday of this week, when doing a search on my name, I saw my articles with the links back to my website. Be taught more on this affiliated wiki by visiting <a href=\"http://www.oceansevendistro.com/\">kaos distro</a>. I have spent income on solo ads, designed a Google adwords campaign, joined numerous traffic exchanges, posted on forums and when all is stated and done the making and submitting of articles so far has been the quickest. I still have not noticed any sales but I anticipate that when end users read my stories that they will come to my website and follow the links I have there to my other internet sites. This, hopefully, will generate sales for me.\n\nYet another post I will be producing today will be on utilizing site visitors exchanges and how to get the most from them. A well-known book said that in order to see final results in this planet you have to be like A purple Cow, you need to stand out from everybody else. I think about myself to be a Purple cow. I do factors differnetly than most individuals and I will always post what I learn and discover.\n\nYet another fantastic benefit of writing and publishing articles is that I can use all the links as reference in a specific section of my resume. I am usually searching at new possibilities and if i want to achieve some perform writing content i can use these links as references.",
