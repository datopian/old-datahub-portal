This is a starting point for research. It is up to users to determine the actual identity of White House visitors.\r\n\r\n> Sunlight makes no assurances of the accuracy of any link provided. Should you encounter an inaccurate link, please contact us, and we'll remove the link. There’s no guarantee that a John Smith listed in the White House’s log is any given John Smith on a Google search results page, so use the information with caution. The visitor logs may not be complete, as the White House has chosen to withhold certain names for reasons of national security, political sensitivity, privacy or other concerns, but it is unclear how many visitors fall under those categories. The current records cover September 15 - November, 2009. Information is delayed by 3-4 months before being released by the White House.\r\n\r\n> The White House has promised to release data on a monthly basis.",
