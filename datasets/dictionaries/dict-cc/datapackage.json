It's an attempt to create a platform where users from all over the world can share their knowledge in the field of translations. Every visitor can suggest new translations and correct or confirm other users' suggestions. The challenging and most important part of the project is the so-called Contribute! system making this process possible.\r\n\r\n> To guarantee that the users' work is not lost in case something happens to the maintainer of dict.cc (Paul Hemetsberger), the resulting vocabulary database can be downloaded anytime. \r\n\r\n### Access/re-use\r\n\r\nThe database and related software can be procured through the [downloads page](http://www.dict.cc/?s=about%3Awordlist).\r\n\r\nThe database file (a zipped flat .txt file) cannot be directly download - but a recent dump is available via email by request, upon agreeing to the [Terms of Use](http://www1.dict.cc/translation_file_request.php?l=e), which stipulate the material is for personal use only - and not for re-distribution or re-use.
