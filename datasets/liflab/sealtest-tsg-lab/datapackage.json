The expertise of our researchers and students revolves around the following axes:\r\n\r\n- computer security, and in particular the detection of attacks and faults in real time\r\n- software testing and verification: how to speed up or even automate the discovery of bugs in a system under development\r\n\r\nThese axes are the source of multiple projects, applied to web applications, network management, video game development and Complex Event Processing, among other things.\r\n\r\nSee our website: [http://liflab.ca](http://liflab.ca)",

  "notes": "This lab contains a set of experiments that compare a test sequence\r\ngeneration library against data found in related works. The lab consists of two parts:\r\n\r\n1. In the first part, test sequences are generated from a set of finite-state machines. Some of these FSMs are extracted from past literature, while others are original to this work. You can see the complete list of all the FSMs included in the lab, along with the source files and pictures for each.\r\n\r\n2. In the second part, test sequences are generated from a set of Linear Temporal Logic formulae.",
