    "description": "Research group based in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, Canada.\r\n\r\nAt LIF, we develop new techniques to discover or prevent bugs in computer systems. The expertise of our researchers and students revolves around the following axes:\r\n\r\n- computer security, and in particular the detection of attacks and faults in real time\r\n- software testing and verification: how to speed up or even automate the discovery of bugs in a system under development\r\n\r\nThese axes are the source of multiple projects, applied to web applications, network management, video game development and Complex Event Processing, among other things.\r\n\r\nSee our website: [http://liflab.ca](http://liflab.ca)",

  "notes": "This lab contains a set of experiments for evaluating the generation\r\ntime and space consumption of peer-action sequences. This is done by creating dummy sequences and measuring these two\r\nparameters. The data generated by this laboratory refers to a journal paper titled *Decentralized Enforcement of Document Lifecycle Constraints*, written by Sylvain Hallé, Raphaël Khoury, Quentin Betti, Yliès Falcone and Tony Hokayem.\r\n\r\nThis archive contains an instance of LabPal, an environment for running\r\nexperiments on a computer and collecting their results in a user-friendly way.\r\nThe author of this archive has set up a set of experiments, which typically involve running scripts on input data, processing their results and displaying them in tables and plots. LabPal is a library that wraps around these experiments and displays them in an easy-to-use web interface. The principle behind LabPal is that all the necessary code, libraries and input data should be bundled within a single self-contained JAR file, such that anyone can download and *easily* reproduce someone else's experiments. Detailed instructions can be found on the LabPal website, [https://liflab.github.io/labpal]",
