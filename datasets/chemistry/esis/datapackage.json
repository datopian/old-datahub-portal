C 146A, 15.6.1990,\r\n * ELINCS (European List of Notified Chemical Substances) in support of Directive 92/32/EEC, the 7th amendment to Directive 67/548/EEC,\r\n * NLP (No-Longer Polymers),\r\n * BPD (Biocidal Products Directive) active substances listed in Annex I or IA of Directive 98/8/EC or listed in the so-called list of non-inclusions,\r\n * PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic) or vPvB (very Persistent and very Bioaccumulative),\r\n * C&L (Classification and Labelling), substances or preparations in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC (substances) and 1999/45/EC (preparations),\r\n * Export and Import of Dangerous Chemicals listed in Annex I of Regulation (EEC) No 304/2003,\r\n * HPVCs (High Production Volume Chemicals) and LPVCs (Low Production Volume Chemicals), including EU Producers/Importers lists,\r\n * IUCLID Chemical Data Sheets, IUCLID Export Files, OECD-IUCLID Export Files, EUSES Export Files,\r\n * Priority Lists, Risk Assessment process and tracking system in relation to Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93 also known as Existing Substances Regulation (ESR).\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\nSome data is available for download, such as the [Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC on Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances](http://ecb.jrc.it/classification-labelling/search-classlab/classlab/downanx1.php). \r\n\r\n * <http://ecb.jrc.it/classification-labelling/search-classlab/classlab/excel/Annex1_EN.zip>\r\n\r\nMost data seems to be browsable through the web interface.\r\n\r\n**Update 2009-04-21**: Wrote to contact addresses for the various databases asking about bulk download facilities.\r\n\r\n### Openness\r\n\r\nIncludes link to the [Copyright notice](http://ec.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm#copyright) on the European Commission website states:\r\n\r\n> Reproduction is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged, save where otherwise stated.\r\n\r\n> Where prior permission must be obtained for the reproduction or use of textual and multimedia information (sound, images, software, etc.), such permission shall cancel the above-mentioned general permission and shall clearly indicate any restrictions on use.\r\n\r\nThere's also a link to a paper on [the Public Availability of Data on EU High Production Volume Chemicals](http://ecb.jrc.it/Data-Availability-Documents/datavail.pdf) -- though this does not seem to mention re-use or re-distribution.",
