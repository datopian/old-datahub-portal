Joel, Jaime Prilusky and I have developed Proteopedia, a\r\n> new online tool/database with the overall goal of making structural\r\n> biology clearer for chemists and biologists by linking textual\r\n> content to 3D structures.\r\n> \r\n> (It's best explained by clicking the green links on the main page at\r\n> www.proteopedia.org)\r\n> \r\n> We came across your article \"Chemistry for everyone\", and felt we\r\n> should share Proteopedia with you as we subscribe to the same belief\r\n> system of open scientific databases accessible to scientists, non-\r\n> scientists, and machines.\r\n> \r\n> We would very much be interested in your opinion of Proteopedia, and\r\n> if you would be interested in a userid/password to edit some pages,\r\n> we would be very please.\r\n> \r\n> Joel wanted me to send you his best regards, and to pass along that\r\n> he is currently abroad and have poor email contact.\r\n> \r\n> Best regards,\r\n> Eran Hodis\r\n",
