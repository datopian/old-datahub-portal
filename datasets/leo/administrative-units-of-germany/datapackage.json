  "description": "Administrative Units of Germany defines the legal administrative boundaries of Germany up to a level of NUTS3 (Nomenclature des unites territoriales statistiques). NUTS is a geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes. In the context of project LEO, we published this dataset as an RDF graph.\r\nFor each feature contained in the source shapefile, a unique URI is created and a spatial literal is attributed to it. The spatial literal corresponds to the closed polygon and defines the underlined area. For example, aug:f1_1 a aug:State ; geo:hasGeometry \"POLYGON ((24.12 34.80, ..., 24.12 34.80))\"^^geo:wktliteral maps an administrative unit, which is a State, to a polygon in the Well Known Text Literal format provided by the GeoSPARQL ontology.",
