  "notes": "The dataset offers Canadian coverge based on the VMAP0 data product which is a global digital dataset produced and maintained by the United States National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA http://www.nima.mil) at a nominal scale of 1:1 000 000. The Atlas of Canada, in wanting to choose an international global digital map base, has adapted the VMAP0 for use as a base from which other, smaller map scales can be created and to which thematic layers can be added.\n\n        The VMAP0 data was first released as the DCW (Digital Chart of the World) dataset. The DCW has been widely used and has proved to be very useful because it was the first global multitheme dataset at such a scale in the public domain. Despite its success, the DCW dataset is widely known to have had some deficiencies. The revision 4 data for North America was much better in quality, but still must be improved before it would be suitable for use by the Atlas of Canada.\n    ",
