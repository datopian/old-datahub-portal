  "notes": "Only a small selection of the country was produced.  The coverage is divided by NTS 1:50 000.\r\n        The inventory for recreational land use capability has 7 Classes, from Class 1 with high capability to Class 7 with very low capability. The classification also examines the quantity of recreational use that a land unit can attract and withstand without permanent damage to the natural landscape.\r\n        Intensive and dispersed activities are recognized in the classification. Intensive activities are those in which relatively large numbers of people may be accommodated per unit area, such as a beach. Dispersed activities are those which normally require a relatively larger area per person such as backcountry camping.\r\n        The inventory is based on interpretation of aerial photographs, field checks, and available records. Capability maps are displayed with a 1:250,000 scale.\r\n    ",
