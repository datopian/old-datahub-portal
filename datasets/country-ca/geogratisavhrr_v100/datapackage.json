  "notes": "Satellite imagery combined with the increased processing capabilities of current image analysis systems have made it possible to generate meaningful data sets which represent new knowledge not available with previous technologies. This land cover data set was derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor operating on board the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. Information on the NOAA series of satellites can be found at http://www.ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca/ccrs/tekrd/satsens/sats/noaae.html.\n\n         The vegetation and land cover information set has been classified into twelve categories. Information on the classification of the vegetation and land cover, raster to vector conversion, generalization for cartographic presentations is included in the paper, \"The Canada Vegetation and Land Cover: A Raster and Vector Data Set for GIS Applications - Uses in Agriculture\".\n\n         A soil quality evaluation was obtained by cross-referencing the AVHRR information with Census of Agriculture records and biophysical (Soil Landscapes of Canada) data and is also included in the above paper.\n\n         AVHRR Land Cover Data approximates a 1:2M scale and was done originally for Agriculture Canada. The 1992 to 1993 coverages are broken down by provinces, territories, and regions. Projection is in Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) 49/77 with origin at 49N 95W. All files are WinZIP compressed .e00 files.\n\n         The complete vegetation and land cover data set for Canada is available in vector format for free download.\n    ",
