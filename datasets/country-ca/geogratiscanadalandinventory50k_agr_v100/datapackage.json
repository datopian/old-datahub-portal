The classes indicate the degree of limitation imposed by the soil in its use for mechanized agriculture.  The subclasses indicate the kinds of limitations that individually or in combination with others, are affecting agricultural land use.  Characteristics of the soil as determined by soil surveys.\n        Only a small selection of the country was produced.  The coverage is divided by NTS 1:50 000.\n    ",
