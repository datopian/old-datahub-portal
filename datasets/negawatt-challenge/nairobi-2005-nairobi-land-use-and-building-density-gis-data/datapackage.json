  "notes": "The land use and building density file was created by manually digitizing a map which was prepared jointly by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Government of the Republic of Kenya under the Japanese Government Technical Cooperation Program. The map was published and printed by the survey of KENYA 1000 in March 2005 and is copyright protected by the Government of Kenya. The creation of this basemap took place over the course of several months in 2003: aerial photography was taken in February 2003 at a scale of 1:15,000; photogrammetric work was completed in August 2003; field identification was completed in November 2003. The land use file was created with the intention of providing a freely accessible, generalized representation of Nairobiâ€™s land use patterns; it should be noted that the JICA map used to generate the land use file obviously possesses a greater degree of accuracy and detail than the land use file itself.",
