  "notes": "**Disclaimer**\r\n\r\nThe data used for this visualisation was collected as part of the Donor Division of Labour Exercise conducted in 2006–2007 in the Aid Information Map (AIM).* All mistakes, errors and omissions in this visualization are the responsibility of Publish What You Fund alone. The data and research reported here do not reflect the official view of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. This data is not used by the Government of Uganda to allocate resources or for any other official purpose and no ministry staff were involved in the development of this visualization.\r\n \r\n*For more details see http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/details.asp?id=143&title=uganda-development-partner-division-labour-exercise, report http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/details.asp?id=143&title=uganda-development-partner-division-labour-exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Intro**\r\n\r\nThe Google Spreadsheet in this package shows spending by the Ugandan government and aid donors on development projects and recurring budget spending, between 2003 and 2007. **The files marked CURRENT-- contain a cleaned and normalised version of this data.**\r\n\r\nFour of the five original tables were obtained from the Ugandan government. They show spending on development and recurring budgets over four years (akin to capital and current spending).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\n * Timescale: The dataset shows actual spending for 2003-4, 2004-5, and 2005-6, and projected donor spending up to 2009-10.\r\n * Format: CSV, Google Docs, and originally in Access - Please contact Publish What You Fund\r\n * Currency: `amount` in UGX (Ugandan Shillings); `amount_dollars` in USD (US Dollars). Some of the data is also provided in the donor's original currency (`amount_donor`); the currency is identified by the column `donorcurrency`.\r\n\r\n**Contacts**\r\n\r\n *  Mark Brough, Publish What You Fund, mark.brough@publishwhatyoufund.org\r\n\r\n\r\n**Changes to the data**\r\n\r\nIn order to create a data set that can be easily analysed, some changes have been made to the data:\r\n\r\n1. Conversion of values to a common currency\r\n      * The original data did not have a common currency throughout the five tables\r\n      * The common currency (UGX, Ugandan Shillings), was created by converting projects in the `FDT` table from USD to UGX. The ratio was based on the ratio found in the `Donor Development` table, using the following conversion rates:\r\n          * 2003/4: 1 USD = 1.847 UGX\r\n          * 2004/5: 1 USD = 1.804 UGX\r\n          * 2005/6: 1 USD = 1.779 UGX \r\n          * All subsequent years used the ratio 1 USD = 1.779 UGX\r\n\r\n2. Normalisation.\r\n      *  In the original data, commitment and disbursement amounts for each year were provided in separate columns.\r\n      *  In the final data, a new row has been created for each year, for both commitment and disbursement. Many of these rows have '0' values for the amounts, which have been retained to allow easy analysis of changes to spending amounts over time. The commitment/disbursement distinction is provided by `spending_type`.\r\n\r\n3. Merging.\r\n    *  The original data was provided in five separate sheets.\r\n        * Government of Uganda spending on Development budget projects (GoU Development)\r\n        * Donor spending on Development budget projects (Donor Development)\r\n        * Non Wage Recurrent spending on recurrent budget programmes (NB: different from projects - Non Wage Recurrent Mapped)\r\n        * Wage Recurrent spending on recurrent budget programmes.\r\n        * FDT data, which is the Donor Development data that was sent to donors to ask them to verify and correct information.\r\n\r\n    *  In the final data, these five sheets have been merged. \r\n        * The existing fields have been retained where they have different meanings, so there are three different fields for `Project`/`Programme`/`Aid Programme` Titles.\r\n        * The original data had some overlap between Donor Development and FDT data. In order to get round this problem, Donor Development rows were marked as `Duplicate` if the same `Project Code` existed in the FDT data. These 'Duplicate' rows have been removed from the final data in order to avoid confusion and to prevent double-counting, but they are freely available on request. \r\n\r\n4. Budget Support.\r\n    *  Budget Support is money given directly to the government which they can spend on their own priorities. General Budget Support is given directly to the Treasury or Finance Ministry, and Sector Budget Support is given to an individual sector. \r\n    *  The Budget Support in the original data was thus double-counting. In order to avoid double-counting but to retain budget support for analysis, budget support 'offset' rows have been created with:\r\n        *  Negative amounts equal to the value of the budget support provided. \r\n        *  `bs_offset` column is set to '1', denoting that a row is a value created to offset budget support from Government of Uganda spending.\r\n        *  This row is then attributed to the Government (via `spending_source_type`) in order to show at the higher levels of aggregation the amount of Government of Uganda Revenues *minus* the amount of budget support.\r\n        *  This is necessary to avoid double-counting when showing aggregations (of Government of Uganda spending, budget support and project aid) at higher levels, but it does not affect the actual amounts in the projects. \r\n        *  An alternate method considered was to pro-rate out the budget support to each project, and show the proportion of funding provided by Government Uganda revenues and then individual donors to that individual project. However, because of the nature of budget support, it is impossible to accurately track it through the system down to an individual project level. Below the higher levels, budget support thus becomes part of Government of Uganda revenues. It is also not possible to discern the different preferences that donors may have in funding one project rather than another, although it is well known that some donors will certainly not like to be seen to be funding certain government projects.\r\n        *  This conceptual shift in revenues from 'Budget Support' to 'Government of Uganda' when looking from the higher, aggregate level, to the lower individual project level is something to bear in mind when working with this data.\r\n\r\n5. Classifications.\r\n    *  The classification used in this data set is `sector` and `subsector`. These are shortened versions of `SWG` and `Sector Objective` respectively. The only change is for the Sector Objective `Disaster Management and Humanitarian Support` which was in the SWG `Macroeconomic and Financial Sector Management`. This seemed to be incorrectly classified so it has been merged into the Sector Objective `Policies and Performance` under the same SWG.",
