  "notes": "The resulting parameters of the cluster analysis for each examined time series of daily numbers of deaths are shown in the data files. The columns represent the codes of causes of death, while the rows represent the cluster parameters. The years represent the middle of the centroids for the identified cluster groups 1 – 4 (Cluster n). The mean square deviation of clusters 1 – 4 (RMSSTD n), based on internal group variability, measures homogeneity of the clusters: higher value of RMSSTD indicates lower homogeneity of the cluster. The RMSSTD was also used for computation of the optimal group numbers. In the next rows, the maximal distance from the centre of cluster for cluster 1 – 4 (Radius n) and spacing of the clusters 1 – 4 (Gap n) are given. The optimization criteria are presented in the last row. It can be seen that higher values of the optimization criteria were reached for acute myocardial infarction (code I21) and brain stroke (code I64).  \r\nFor the investigated diseases of the circulatory system occurs most years cluster centroids  if found in the maximum of the solar cycle in 2000 – 2003 slightly less than the upward phase of the cycle and at the minimum before the start. The clusters centroids  are located at the maximum and both minima of the solar cycle. This may suggests changes in the nature of the proceses in years of high solar activity, which culminates in the amount of high-energy protons in the solar wind and geomagnetic activity variations, and in the ascending phase of the solar cycle. The changes in the type of cardiovascular mortality, depending on level of solar activity in the long term.",
