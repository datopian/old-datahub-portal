      "description": "The paper focuses on how majority of women who make up a large proportion of Nigeriaâ€™s 140 million citizens will earn their own money and also take charge of changing their personal lives and investments. Through small and medium scale business, women are finding new ways of working that make more sense for their lives and for the lives of their partners and children and extended families as well. To have an impact on the national economic development, women entrepreneurs have to be recognized, and policy to make them more self sustained have to be put in place. There is no gainsaying the fact that women will use this power to improve society in ways we can only begin to imagine.  A small and medium scale entrepreneurship will help them to be financially stable and become empowered thereby achieving the third Millennium Development Goals objective of eradicating extreme hunger and poverty.",

      "description": "The politics of management and the management of politics in the workplace have received a great deal of attention due to their image of pervasiveness, mystery and potential benefits for those who know how to use them in the struggle over resources. This study therefore sought to examine the factors that influence organizational politics and the perceived effects on employees from the perspective of employees. Three banks were selected from Accra metropolis and fifty (50) respondents selected using convenience sampling. Analyzing the data with simple statistical frequency, percentage distribution, and tables, it was revealed that, nepotism and favoritism are the major factors which influence organizational politics. It was therefore, recommended that, nepotism and favoritism should be eliminated or reduced to avoid anxiety and stress, job insecurity and employee turnover.",

      "description": "The issue of technological advancement and poverty alleviation in developing countries is still gingering to experience a major take-off. This study attempts to show that a blend of scientific research and indigenous technology can improve upon industrial productivity. The study assessed the methods for the extraction of shea butter by understanding their principles and determined the best method in terms of yield (volume of oil/kilogram of nut). The yield of Traditional, mechanical press, and solvent extraction methods were determined by extracting 1000g of the nuts. The experiment revealed that the standardized traditional extraction method produce 493.9ml/kg. The mechanical gave a significantly lower yield, 366.7ml/kg and the chemical extraction method (with n-hexane as the solvent) gave a much higher yield, 560ml/kg indicating that extraction can only be improved by chemical means and not mechanical. The mechanical press method was tested on roasted and unroasted nuts and the average yield in each case are 366.7ml/kg, and 251.3ml respectively. The study concluded that the yield of shea butter extraction methods cannot be optimized without taking into consideration the chemical principles involved. Thus the industry can be made viable to generate more income for the nation when research outcome are utilized to standardize and optimize its productivity.",

      "description": "The pivotal role played by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in providing the essential stimulus required in attaining a sustainable growth and development in every economy cannot be over-emphasized. However, harnessing and optimal utilization of this tool has been hindered by multitude of forces especially finance in the developing and less developed countries. Using the Pearson Moment Correlation Co-efficient and Regression to analyze a secondary data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin, This study examines the nature of the relationship between micro finance availability and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) business performance in Nigeria using the ratio of credit to SME to total credit against SME output to GDP in Nigeria. The findings revealed the existence of a weak negative relationship between the loan ratio and the contribution to the GDP ratio (-0.269) which implies that finance is not the only or main problem facing the emergence, survival, sustenance and development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) business in Nigeria. Hence, there is an urgent need to put in place all essential conditions such as enabling environment, effective infrastructures required to ensure the efficient exploitation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) opportunities.

      "description": "Education plays a key role in the development of every nation, as a result, government and partners in education try to ensure not only the quality but the efficiency and the transparency in everything that has to do with education. This calls for the introduction and adherence to internal control policies and procedures. To be effective, the internal control systems must have the strong support of the entityâ€™s leadership and most importantly, policies and procedures must be complied with consistently throughout the organization. The main focus of the study was on the role of Internal Control Systems in School Administration from selected Senior High Schools (SHS) within the Adentan and Dodowa Municipality. The study revealed that although internal control systems were in operation, there were challenges with their implementation. These challenges bothered on ethical issues, hence the need for adequate and regular training of administrative and accounting staff. It is recommended that both accounting and administrative staff undergo periodic updating in internal control systems.",
