  "notes": "###About\r\n\r\n\"The development of early American animation is represented by this collection of 21 animated films and 2 fragments, which spans the years 1900 to 1921. The films include clay, puppet, and cut-out animation, as well as pen drawings. They point to a connection between newspaper comic strips and early animated films, as represented by Keeping Up With the Joneses, Krazy Kat, and The Katzenjammer Kids. As well as showing the development of animation, these films also reveal the social attitudes of early twentieth-century America.\"\r\n\r\n###License\r\n\r\n\"The Library of Congress is providing access to these materials for educational and research purposes and makes no warranty with regard to their use for other purposes.
