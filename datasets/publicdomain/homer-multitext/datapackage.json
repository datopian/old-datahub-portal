  "notes": "### Description\r\n\r\nFrom home page:\r\n\r\n> The Homer Multitext project, the first of its kind in Homeric studies, seeks to present the textual transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey  in a historical framework. Such a framework is needed to account for the full reality of a complex medium of oral performance that underwent many changes over a long period of time. These changes, as reflected in the many texts of Homer, need to be understood in their many different historical contexts. The Homer Multitext provides ways to view these contexts both synchronically and diachronically.\r\n\r\nCurrently (2009-01) has scans of the Venetus A version of the Iliad. These are licensed under CC by-nc-sa. Details from <http://chs.harvard.edu/chs/manuscript_images>:\r\n\r\n> The images allow unprecedented access to three manuscripts of the Iliad, now housed in the Marciana Library in Venice, Italy: the tenth-century Marcianus Graecus Z. 454 (= 822), the eleventh-century Marcianus Graecus Z. 453 (= 821), and the twelfth/thirteenth-century Marcianus Graecus Z. 458 (= 841). Marcianus Graecus Z. 454, commonly called the “Venetus A,” is the manuscript on which all modern editions of the Iliad are primarily based. The Venetus A is a deluxe edition unparalleled in beauty and design by any other surviving manuscript of the Iliad. It is extremely valuable for the scholarly commentary it contains in its margins, much of which derives from the work of scholars affiliated with the library of Ptolemaic Alexandria in the second and first centuries BCE. The Marcianus Graecus Z. 453, known as the “Venetus B,” and the twelfth/thirteenth-century Marcianus Graecus Z. 458 preserve in their margins commentary different from that of the Venetus A, providing us with even more information about the epics and how they have been interpreted in the past. With the publication of these high-resolution images, and in publications to follow, the manuscripts can be viewed and read in thorough detail.\r\n\r\n### Access\r\n\r\nIn theory scan material is available from download url but not working (info about being taken down on Sept 9 2008 to move images). Web interface appears to work fine.",
