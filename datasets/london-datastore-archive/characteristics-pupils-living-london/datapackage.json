  "notes": "<p>The GLA provides roll projections  to 25 London boroughs, and has now produced pilot pan-London roll projections. These are supplemented by two sets of EXCEL files, reflecting conclusions in earlier Education Research Briefings and discussion with London boroughs.\n</p>\n<p>Taken together the EXCEL files include approximately 100 Tables, and provide a wide range of information on locally-resident children and on the schools they attend, wherever these may be. They cover issues such as age, gender, mother tongue, ethnicity, poverty, and SEN. A comparison of the data in the Tables with information held by London boroughs will indicate how far school intake mirrors the characteristics of the locally-resident pupil population at borough/county district level.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, the longitudinal Tables provide indicators of inward mobility to individual boroughs and county countricts, as well as of the number of children of compulsory school age who 'go missing' from state schooling.\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/pupil-characteristics-2008.zip\">2008 Pupil Characteristics - Excel File</a> (Zip file)\n</p>\n<p>[2006/07 Longitudinal Pupil Characteristics<br />\n- Excel File](<a href=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/longitudinal-pupil-characteristics-06-07.xls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/londondatastore-upload/longitudinal-pupil-characteristics-06-07.xls</a>)\n</p>",
