  "description": "<p>Since 2006 the GLA Group has been implementing the London Living Wage (LLW).The Group continues to include the LLW as a requirement for contracts that are let or renewed.</p>\r\n<p>We calculate the Living Wage by a combination of two approaches. The first, developed by the Family Budget Unit (FBU), estimates the costs of a &lsquo;Low Cost but Acceptable&rsquo; (LCA) budget for a selection of households and calculates the wage required to meet these costs. This is termed the &ldquo;Basic Living Costs&rdquo; approach. The second &ndash; the &ldquo;Income Distribution&rdquo; approach &ndash; simply identifies the median income for London (appropriately weighted for 11 household types) and then takes 60 per cent of it.</p>\r\n<p>The Mayor continues to lobby national Government to adopt the London Living Wage across Whitehall.</p>",
