  "notes": "<p>National Curriculum Assessments at Key Stage 2. Attainment by Location of school.<br /><br />Attainment at key stage 2 in reading test, writing TA and mathematics test by local authority, region and gender. <br />Percentage of pupils achieving levels 4+, 4B+ and 5+.<br /><br />Figures for academies, free schools and CTCs are included in the individual LA figures and also in the total for England state-funded schools. Figures for hospital schools and pupil referral units are excluded.</p>\r\n<p>Level 4b is not included in the STA data but is derived from the test level and marks. A pupil with a mark in the top two thirds of the level 4 mark range or with level 5 or 6 is deemed to be at level 4b or above. It should be noted that these figures are not subject to the same statistical equating as the level thresholds to ensure that national standards are maintained. In addition, the level 4 mark range is not always an exact multiple of three. Changes over time at level 4b or above should therefore be interpreted with care.</p>\r\n<p>Level 6 tests were re-introduced in 2012.&nbsp; Any pupils achieving level 6 are included in the level 5 or above figures.</p>\r\n<p>The 'England state-funded schools' figures published here may be slightly different from the 'England state-funded schools only' figures published in the performance tables and the national tables in this SFR. The figures presented here have been calculated on the same basis as the LA figures in this table (i.e. excluding pupils discounted as recently arrived from overseas but including pupils with missing results or pending maladministration). However, those in the performance tables are calculated on the same basis as the overall national figures (i.e. including pupils recently arrived from overseas but excluding those with missing results or pending maladministration).</p>\r\n<p>The England all schools figures include those independent schools who chose to take part in key stage 2 assessments.</p>\r\n<p>Figures for City of London and Isles of Scilly local authorities for 2015 have been suppressed due to low school numbers.</p>\r\n<p><br />Coverage: England, state-funded schools. Data covers pupils in maintained schools in England and who are resident in England</p>",
