Recycling/composting rates for 1998-99 were first published in Annex A of \"Guidance in Municipal Waste Management Strategies\" published by DEFRA in March 2001 and 1999/00 rates in Annex B of the consultation paper on \"Distribution of the Â£140 Million Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund\", available from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-and-recycling-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-and-recycling-statistics</a>\n</p>\n<p>The recycling rate is calculated as set out below.\n</p>\n<p>For Waste Collection Authorities (WCA) and Unitary Authorities (UA):<br />\nX/Y x 100, where:<br />\nX = Tonnage of household waste collected by the WCA or UA which is sent for recycling/composting (including private/voluntary collections of household waste for recycling)<br />\nY = Total tonnage of household waste collected by the WCA or UA (including private/voluntary collections of household waste for recycling)<br />\n\n</p>\n<p>For Waste Disposal Authorities (WDA):<br />\nX/Y x 100, where:<br />\nX = Tonnage of household waste collected by the WDA which is sent for recycling plus tonnage of household waste which is sent for recycling by the constituent WCAs (including private/voluntary collections of household waste for recycling)<br />\nY = Total tonnage of household waste collected at Civic Amenity sites by the WDA plus total tonnage of household waste collected by constituent WCAs (including private/voluntary collections of household waste for recycling)\n</p>\n<p>Annual Results for Local authority collected waste management published by  are available <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results\" title=\"Annual Results for Local authority collected waste management\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>For more Local Authority Waste and Recycling Information visit the <a href=\"http://laportal.wrap.org.uk/\">WRAP Portal</a>.
