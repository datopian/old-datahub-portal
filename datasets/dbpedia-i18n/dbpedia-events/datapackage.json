    "description": "DBpedia is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from wwwWikipedia and make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia, and to link the different data sets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We hope that this work will make it easier for the huge amount of information in Wikipedia to be used in some new interesting ways. Furthermore, it might inspire new mechanisms for navigating, linking, and improving the encyclopedia itself.",

  "notes": "Wikipedia is the largest encyclopedia worldwide and is frequently updated by thousands of collaborators.\r\nCurrently, there are exactly 287~language versions of Wikipedia with together hundreds of edits per minute.\r\nA large part of the knowledge in Wikipedia is not static, but frequently updated, e.g., new movies or sports and political events.\r\nThis makes Wikipedia an extremely rich, crowdsourced information hub for events.\r\nHowever, currently there is no structured and standardized way to access information on those events and it is cumbersome to filter and enrich them manually.\r\nWe have created a dataset based on a~live extraction of Wikipedia, which performs this task via rules for filtering and ranking changes in Wikipedia. \r\nThe resulting data benefits from background knowledge in DBpedia to enable interesting mashups of events.",
