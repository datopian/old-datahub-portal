  "notes": "<blockquote>\r\n<p>Our network availability information is here to inform you of the network&rsquo;s capability to connect large-scale developments to major substations. <br /> </p>\r\n<p>Distributed energy, also known as district or decentralized energy is generated or stored by a variety of small, grid-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources (DER) or distributed energy resource systems, which are served by the central plants. One subset of Distributed energy is Distributed Generation (known as DG). Distributed Generation is electricity that is normally exported on to the distribution network or used to supply a local demand. <br /> </p>\r\n<p>The following dataset shows the location of the distribution substations, maximum demands, total distributed generation connected to that substation and the total capacity of the substation, and the postcode area served by each substation for the Leeds Authority.</p>\r\n<h2>Legal disclaimer</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have developed the network availability information to assist with connections applications in constrained areas. The information gives generation availability constraints only and cannot be relied upon to assess the terms of connection for specific premises. Nothing in this disclaimer limits or excludes our liability for; <br /> (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; <br /> (b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or <br /> (c) any other liability that cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law.<br /> </li>\r\n<li>Subject to the above, we shall not be liable to you in tort (including negligence) or otherwise, arising under or in connection with your use of the network availability information for; <br /> (a) loss of profits; <br /> (b) loss of sales or business; <br /> (c) loss of agreements or contracts; <br /> (d) loss of anticipated savings; <br /> (e) loss of or damage to goodwill; or <br /> (f) any indirect or consequential loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>",
